# v2.13.0

## Highlights

This release improves reliability across session recovery, RPI cleanup, and release validation, while adding a new security-suite workflow for binary assurance. It also delivers symbol-level plan specs, inline skill examples, and tighter worktree path safety.

## What's New

- **Security-suite workflow** — Added `/security-suite` for composable binary assurance with static/dynamic evidence capture, drift detection, and policy gating.
- **Stronger session and recovery guardrails** — Added context-guard assignment mapping plus proactive handoff and one-shot recovery markers to reduce stale session drift.
- **Safer stale-run operations** — Added stale run detection, terminal metadata persistence, and `ao rpi cleanup` with configurable worktree cleanup behavior.
- **Symbol-level plan specs** — `/plan` now generates file inventory tables, exact function references with line numbers, and named test functions for implementation-ready specs.
- **Inline quick-start examples** — `/evolve` and `/vibe` skills now include working examples for faster onboarding.

## All Changes

- Added context-guard protections that improve assignment tracking and recovery behavior during handoffs.
- Added broader Claude team context handling support in `ao` and related documentation.
- Added security-suite primitives for binary-oriented assurance workflows.
- Added stale-run detection and cleanup tooling for phased RPI runs.
- Added symbol-level implementation detail to `/plan` skill output.
- Added inline quick-start examples to `/evolve` and `/vibe` skill docs.
- Added `references/` directory for skill lint tooling.
- Added destructive path tests for worktree validation.
- Added `npx skills update` troubleshooting guidance.
- Updated install guidance to prioritize Claude marketplace/plugin install, with `npx skills` documented as the cross-agent path.
- Standardized Homebrew upgrade guidance and improved installer fallback messaging.
- Improved repository hygiene by fully ignoring generated `.agents/` local artifacts.
- Shifted release validation to local CI parity (`scripts/ci-local-release.sh`) with GitHub Actions release workflow acting as publisher-only.
- Updated validate scripts for tier renames and ruff output format changes.
- Fixed Claude plugin marketplace compatibility by removing an unsupported manifest key.
- Fixed phased RPI reliability in stream startup/fallback and stale-run cleanup path validation.
- Fixed hook/runtime and CLI quality regressions, including lint/staticcheck and complexity-threshold issues.
- Fixed worktree path validation to prevent destructive operations on invalid paths.
