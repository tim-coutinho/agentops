# v2.12.0

## Highlights

This release hardens the full RPI flywheel end-to-end: phased execution is more deterministic, hook coverage/install behavior is more reliable, and validation/security gates are stricter and safer by default.

## What's New

- **Stronger phased RPI engine** — Added swarm-first backend routing, deterministic queue behavior, run-scoped artifact contracts, and improved lifecycle/failure propagation.
- **MemRL foundation wiring** — Added deterministic policy/export contracts and broader knowledge/flywheel integration plumbing.
- **Hook install/runtime reliability** — Full hook coverage is now the default path in `ao init --hooks`, and hook helper dependencies are installed and handled more defensively.

## All Changes

- Added validation and security coverage, including changed-scope race gating and blocking security checks in CI.
- Aligned docs/tests around the 3-phase RPI model and tightened skill-routing guidance.
- Fixed reliability and correctness issues across hook gating, phased RPI preflight/watchdog behavior, retrieval effectiveness, and key `ao doctor`/pool edge cases.
