# v2.16.0

## Highlights

- **Evolve idle hardening** — 52% of evolve commits in production were idle noise. Now idle cycles aren't committed, stagnation is disk-derived (survives compaction), and a 60-minute circuit breaker stops runaway sessions.
- **Evolve `--quality` mode** — New flag inverts the priority cascade: post-mortem findings before goals. Harvested work has 100% first-attempt success rate in production (15/15 items). Quality scoring tracks unconsumed findings.
- **6-phase RPI E2E tests** — Full lifecycle validation: gate retries, complexity scaling, phase summaries, promise tags. Catches integration regressions that unit tests miss.
- **8 `ao` CLI bug fixes** — Pool matching, artifact counts, score display, symlink detection, JSON truncation, and more (#41-#48).

## What's New

### Evolve Skill Overhaul
The evolve skill received three major improvements based on analysis of 179 production cycles (117 commits, 7.5 days of autonomous operation):
- Idle cycles are no longer committed to git, reducing commit noise by ~52%
- Rolling fitness files (`fitness-latest.json`) replace per-cycle snapshots
- Canonical `cycle-history.jsonl` schema standardized across all entry types
- New `--quality` mode prioritizes unconsumed post-mortem findings

### CLI Fixes
Eight bugs fixed across `ao` subcommands, all with issue tracking (#41-#48). Notable: v1 GOALS.yaml now accepted with deprecation warning + migration path.

### Skill Maintenance
13 skills received targeted fixes: dead links, stale references, missing catalog entries, vaporware sections removed, fixture paths corrected.

### Testing
Fixture-based CLI regression tests and a 6-phase RPI E2E test suite added for comprehensive lifecycle validation.
