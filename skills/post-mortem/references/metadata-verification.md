# Pre-Council Metadata Verification

**Mechanically verify delivered artifacts against the plan BEFORE council. Catches metadata errors that LLMs estimate instead of measure (L19, L22, L24).**

```bash

  # Extract file paths mentioned in plan
  for planned_file in $(grep -oP '`([^`]+\.(go|py|ts|js|md|yaml|yml|sh))`' "$PLAN_DOC" 2>/dev/null | tr -d '`' | sort -u); do

# Check git log for claimed counts in commit messages

**If failures found:** Include them in the council packet as `context.metadata_failures`. Tag as MECHANICAL — council judges should focus on plan compliance, tech debt, and learnings instead of re-discovering broken links or wrong counts.

**If plan doc found:** Compare planned deliverables (file paths, issue counts) against actual. Mismatches become pre-loaded findings for the `plan-compliance` judge.

**Why:** Post-mortem councils were spending judge cycles on metadata errors (wrong line counts, missing files, broken cross-refs) that are mechanically verifiable. Pre-council verification frees judges to focus on structural assessment and learning extraction.
