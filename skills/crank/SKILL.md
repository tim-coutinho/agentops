# Crank Skill

> **Quick Ref:** Autonomous epic execution. `/swarm` for each wave with runtime-native spawning. Output: closed issues + final vibe.

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

Autonomous execution: implement all issues until the epic is DONE.

**CLI dependencies:** bd (issue tracking), ao (knowledge flywheel). Both optional — see `skills/shared/SKILL.md` for fallback table. If bd is unavailable, use TaskList for issue tracking and skip beads sync. If ao is unavailable, skip knowledge injection/extraction.

For Claude runtime feature coverage (agents/hooks/worktree/settings), see `skills/shared/references/claude-code-latest-features.md`.

## Architecture: Crank + Swarm

**Beads mode** (bd available):
```
Crank (orchestrator)           Swarm (executor)
    |                              |
    +-> bd ready (wave issues)     |
    |                              |
    +-> TaskCreate from beads  --->+-> Select spawn backend (codex sub-agents | claude teams | fallback)
    |                              |
    +-> /swarm                 --->+-> Spawn workers per backend
    |                              |   (fresh context per wave)
    +-> Verify + bd update     <---+-> Workers report via backend channel
    |                              |
    +-> Loop until epic DONE   <---+-> Cleanup backend resources after wave
```

**TaskList mode** (bd unavailable):
```
Crank (orchestrator, TaskList mode)    Swarm (executor)
    |                                      |
    +-> TaskList() (wave tasks)            |
    |                                      |
    +-> /swarm                         --->+-> Select spawn backend per wave
    |                                      |
    +-> Verify via TaskList()          <---+-> Workers report via backend channel
    |                                      |
    +-> Loop until all completed       <---+-> Cleanup backend resources after wave
```

**Separation of concerns:**
- **Crank** = Orchestration, epic/task lifecycle, knowledge flywheel
- **Swarm** = Runtime-native parallel execution (Ralph Wiggum pattern via fresh worker set per wave)

Ralph alignment source: `skills/shared/references/ralph-loop-contract.md` (fresh context, scheduler/worker split, disk-backed state, backpressure).

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--test-first` | off | Enable spec-first TDD: SPEC WAVE generates contracts, TEST WAVE generates failing tests, IMPL WAVES make tests pass |
| `--per-task-commits` | off | Opt-in per-task commit strategy. Falls back to wave-batch when file boundaries overlap. See `references/commit-strategies.md`. |

## Global Limits

**MAX_EPIC_WAVES = 50** (hard limit across entire epic)

This prevents infinite loops on circular dependencies or cascading failures.

**Why 50?**
- Typical epic: 5-10 issues
- With retries: ~5 waves max
- 50 = safe upper bound

## Completion Enforcement (The Sisyphus Rule)

**THE SISYPHUS RULE:** Not done until explicitly DONE.

After each wave, output completion marker:
- `<promise>DONE</promise>` - Epic truly complete, all issues closed
- `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` - Cannot proceed (with reason)
- `<promise>PARTIAL</promise>` - Incomplete (with remaining items)

**Never claim completion without the marker.**

## Execution Steps

Given `/crank [epic-id | plan-file.md | "description"]`:

### Step 0: Load Knowledge Context (ao Integration)

**Search for relevant learnings before starting the epic:**

```bash
# If ao CLI available, inject prior knowledge about epic execution
if command -v ao &>/dev/null; then
    # Search for relevant learnings
    ao search "epic execution implementation patterns" 2>/dev/null | head -20

    # Check flywheel status
    ao flywheel status 2>/dev/null

    # Get current ratchet state
    ao ratchet status 2>/dev/null
fi
```

If ao not available, skip this step and proceed. The knowledge flywheel enhances but is not required.

### Step 0.5: Detect Tracking Mode

```bash
if command -v bd &>/dev/null; then
  TRACKING_MODE="beads"
else
  TRACKING_MODE="tasklist"
  echo "Note: bd CLI not found. Using TaskList for issue tracking."
fi
```

**Tracking mode determines the source of truth for the rest of the workflow:**

| | Beads Mode | TaskList Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Source of truth** | `bd` (beads issues) | TaskList (Claude-native) |
| **Find work** | `bd ready` | `TaskList()` → pending, unblocked |
| **Get details** | `bd show <id>` | `TaskGet(taskId)` |
| **Mark complete** | `bd update <id> --status closed` | `TaskUpdate(taskId, status="completed")` |
| **Track retries** | `bd comments add` | Task description update |
| **Epic tracking** | `bd update <epic-id> --append-notes` | In-memory wave counter |

### Step 1: Identify the Epic / Work Source

**Beads mode:**

**If epic ID provided:** Use it directly. Do NOT ask for confirmation.

**If no epic ID:** Discover it:
```bash
bd list --type epic --status open 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If multiple epics found, ask user which one.

**TaskList mode:**

If input is an epic ID → Error: "bd CLI required for beads epic tracking. Install bd or provide a plan file / task list."

If input is a plan file path (`.md`):
1. Read the plan file
2. Decompose into TaskList tasks (one `TaskCreate` per distinct work item)
3. Set up dependencies via `TaskUpdate(addBlockedBy)`
4. Proceed to Step 3

If no input:
1. Check `TaskList()` for existing pending tasks
2. If tasks exist, use them as the work items
3. If no tasks, ask user what to work on

If input is a description string:
1. Decompose into tasks (`TaskCreate` for each)
2. Set up dependencies
3. Proceed to Step 3

### Step 1a: Initialize Wave Counter

**Beads mode:**
```bash
# Initialize crank tracking in epic notes
bd update <epic-id> --append-notes "CRANK_START: wave=0 at $(date -Iseconds)" 2>/dev/null
```

**TaskList mode:** Track wave counter in memory only. No external state needed.

Track in memory: `wave=0`

### Step 1b: Detect Test-First Mode (--test-first only)

```bash
# Check for --test-first flag
if [[ "$TEST_FIRST" == "true" ]]; then
    # Classify issues by type
    # spec-eligible: feature, bug, task → SPEC + TEST waves apply
    # skip: chore, epic, docs → standard implementation waves only
    SPEC_ELIGIBLE=()
    SPEC_SKIP=()

    if [[ "$TRACKING_MODE" == "beads" ]]; then
        for issue in $READY_ISSUES; do
            ISSUE_TYPE=$(bd show "$issue" 2>/dev/null | grep "Type:" | head -1 | awk '{print tolower($NF)}')
            case "$ISSUE_TYPE" in
                feature|bug|task) SPEC_ELIGIBLE+=("$issue") ;;
                chore|epic|docs) SPEC_SKIP+=("$issue") ;;
                *)
                    echo "WARNING: Issue $issue has unknown type '$ISSUE_TYPE'. Defaulting to spec-eligible."
                    SPEC_ELIGIBLE+=("$issue")
                    ;;
            esac
        done
    else
        # TaskList mode: no bd available, default all to spec-eligible
        SPEC_ELIGIBLE=($READY_ISSUES)
        echo "TaskList mode: all ${#SPEC_ELIGIBLE[@]} issues defaulted to spec-eligible (no bd type info)"
    fi
    echo "Test-first mode: ${#SPEC_ELIGIBLE[@]} spec-eligible, ${#SPEC_SKIP[@]} skipped (chore/epic/docs)"
fi
```

If `--test-first` is NOT set, skip Steps 3b and 3c entirely — behavior is unchanged.

### Step 2: Get Epic Details

**Beads mode:**
```bash
bd show <epic-id> 2>/dev/null
```

**TaskList mode:** `TaskList()` to see all tasks and their status/dependencies.

### Step 3: List Ready Issues (Current Wave)

**Beads mode:**

Find issues that can be worked on (no blockers):
```bash
bd ready 2>/dev/null
```

**`bd ready` returns the current wave** - all unblocked issues. These can be executed in parallel because they have no dependencies on each other.

**TaskList mode:**

`TaskList()` → filter for status=pending, no blockedBy (or all blockers completed). These are the current wave.

### Step 3a: Pre-flight Check - Issues Exist

**Verify there are issues to work on:**

**If 0 ready issues found (beads mode) or 0 pending unblocked tasks (TaskList mode):**
```
STOP and return error:
  "No ready issues found for this epic. Either:
   - All issues are blocked (check dependencies)
   - Epic has no child issues (run /plan first)
   - All issues already completed"
```

Also verify: epic has at least 1 child issue total. An epic with 0 children means /plan was not run.

Do NOT proceed with empty issue list - this produces false "epic complete" status.

### Step 3a.1: Pre-flight Check - Pre-Mortem Required (3+ issues)

**If the epic has 3 or more child issues, require pre-mortem evidence before proceeding.**

```bash
# Count child issues (beads mode)
if [[ "$TRACKING_MODE" == "beads" ]]; then
    CHILD_COUNT=$(bd show "$EPIC_ID" 2>/dev/null | grep -c "↳")
else
    CHILD_COUNT=$(TaskList | grep -c "pending\|in_progress")
fi

if [[ "$CHILD_COUNT" -ge 3 ]]; then
    # Look for pre-mortem report in .agents/council/
    PRE_MORTEM=$(ls -t .agents/council/*pre-mortem* 2>/dev/null | head -1)
    if [[ -z "$PRE_MORTEM" ]]; then
        echo "STOP: Epic has $CHILD_COUNT issues but no pre-mortem evidence found."
        echo "Run '/pre-mortem' first to validate the plan before cranking."
        echo "<promise>BLOCKED</promise>"
        echo "Reason: pre-mortem required for epics with 3+ issues"
        # STOP - do not continue
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "Pre-mortem evidence found: $PRE_MORTEM"
fi
```

**Why:** 7 consecutive epics (ag-oke through ag-9ad) showed positive ROI from pre-mortem validation. For epics with 3+ issues, the cost of a pre-mortem (~2 min) is negligible compared to the cost of cranking a flawed plan.

### Step 3b: SPEC WAVE (--test-first only)

**Skip if `--test-first` is NOT set or if no spec-eligible issues exist.**

For each spec-eligible issue (feature/bug/task):
1. **TaskCreate** with subject `SPEC: <issue-title>`
2. Worker receives: issue description, plan boundaries, contract template (`skills/crank/references/contract-template.md`), codebase access (read-only)
3. Worker generates: `.agents/specs/contract-<issue-id>.md`
4. **Validation:** files_exist + content_check for `## Invariants` AND `## Test Cases`
5. Lead commits all specs after validation

For BLOCKED recovery and full worker prompt, read `skills/crank/references/test-first-mode.md`.

### Step 3c: TEST WAVE (--test-first only)

**Skip if `--test-first` is NOT set or if no spec-eligible issues exist.**

For each spec-eligible issue:
1. **TaskCreate** with subject `TEST: <issue-title>`
2. Worker receives: contract-<issue-id>.md + codebase types (NOT implementation code)
3. Worker generates: failing test files in appropriate location
4. **RED Gate:** Lead runs test suite — ALL new tests must FAIL
5. Lead commits test harness after RED Gate passes

For RED Gate enforcement and retry logic, read `skills/crank/references/test-first-mode.md`.

**Summary:** SPEC WAVE generates contracts from issues → TEST WAVE generates failing tests from contracts → RED Gate verifies all new tests fail before proceeding. Docs/chore/ci issues bypass both waves.

### Step 4: Execute Wave via Swarm

**GREEN mode (--test-first only):** If `--test-first` is set and SPEC/TEST waves have completed, modify worker prompts for spec-eligible issues:
- Include in each worker's TaskCreate: `"Failing tests exist at <test-file-paths>. Make them pass. Do NOT modify test files. See GREEN Mode rules in /implement SKILL.md."`
- Workers receive: failing tests (immutable), contract, issue description
- Workers follow GREEN Mode rules from `/implement` SKILL.md
- Docs/chore/ci issues (skipped by SPEC/TEST waves) use standard worker prompts unchanged

**BEFORE each wave:**
```bash
wave=$((wave + 1))
WAVE_START_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

if [[ "$TRACKING_MODE" == "beads" ]]; then
    bd update <epic-id> --append-notes "CRANK_WAVE: $wave at $(date -Iseconds)" 2>/dev/null
fi

# CHECK GLOBAL LIMIT
if [[ $wave -ge 50 ]]; then
    echo "<promise>BLOCKED</promise>"
    echo "Global wave limit (50) reached."
    # STOP - do not continue
fi
```

**Cross-cutting constraint injection (SDD):**

Before spawning workers, check for cross-cutting constraints:

```bash
# Guard clause: skip if plan has no boundaries (backward compat)
PLAN_FILE=$(ls -t .agents/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -n "$PLAN_FILE" ]] && grep -q "## Boundaries" "$PLAN_FILE"; then
    # Extract "Always" boundaries and convert to cross_cutting checks
    # Read the plan's ## Cross-Cutting Constraints section or derive from ## Boundaries
    # Inject into every TaskCreate's metadata.validation.cross_cutting
fi
# "Ask First" boundaries: in auto mode, log as annotation only (no blocking)
# In --interactive mode, prompt before proceeding
```

When creating TaskCreate for each wave issue, include cross-cutting constraints in metadata:
```json
{
  "validation": {
    "files_exist": [...],
    "content_check": {...},
    "cross_cutting": [
      {"name": "...", "type": "content_check", "file": "...", "pattern": "..."}
    ]
  }
}
```

**For wave execution details (beads sync, TaskList bridging, swarm invocation), read `skills/crank/references/team-coordination.md`.**

**Cross-cutting validation (SDD):**

After per-task validation passes, run cross-cutting checks across all files modified in the wave:

```bash
# Only if cross_cutting constraints were injected
if [[ -n "$CROSS_CUTTING_CHECKS" ]]; then
    WAVE_FILES=$(git diff --name-only "${WAVE_START_SHA}..HEAD")
    for check in $CROSS_CUTTING_CHECKS; do
        run_validation_check "$check" "$WAVE_FILES"
    done
fi
```

### Step 5: Verify and Sync to Beads (MANDATORY)

> Swarm executes per-task validation (see `skills/shared/validation-contract.md`). Crank trusts swarm validation and focuses on beads sync.

**For verification details, retry logic, and failure escalation, read `skills/crank/references/team-coordination.md` and `skills/crank/references/failure-recovery.md`.**

### Step 5.5: Wave Acceptance Check (MANDATORY)

> **Principle:** Verify each wave meets acceptance criteria using lightweight inline judges. No skill invocations — prevents context explosion in the orchestrator loop.

**For acceptance check details (diff computation, inline judges, verdict gating), read `skills/crank/references/wave-patterns.md`.**

### Step 5.7: Wave Checkpoint

After each wave completes (post-vibe-gate, pre-next-wave), write a checkpoint file:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/crank

cat > ".agents/crank/wave-${wave}-checkpoint.json" <<EOF
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "wave": ${wave},
  "timestamp": "$(date -Iseconds)",
  "tasks_completed": $(echo "$COMPLETED_IDS" | jq -R 'split(" ")'),
  "tasks_failed": $(echo "$FAILED_IDS" | jq -R 'split(" ")'),
  "files_changed": $(git diff --name-only "${WAVE_START_SHA}..HEAD" | jq -R . | jq -s .),
  "git_sha": "$(git rev-parse HEAD)",
  "acceptance_verdict": "<PASS|WARN|FAIL>",
  "commit_strategy": "<per-task|wave-batch|wave-batch-fallback>"
}
EOF
```

- `COMPLETED_IDS` / `FAILED_IDS`: space-separated issue IDs from the wave results.
- `acceptance_verdict`: verdict from the Wave Acceptance Check (Step 5.5). Used by final validation to skip redundant /vibe on clean epics.
- On retry of the same wave, the file is overwritten (same path).

### Step 6: Check for More Work

After completing a wave, check for newly unblocked issues (beads: `bd ready`, TaskList: `TaskList()`). Loop back to Step 4 if work remains, or proceed to Step 7 when done.

**For detailed check/retry logic, read `skills/crank/references/team-coordination.md`.**

### Step 7: Final Batched Validation

When all issues complete, run ONE comprehensive vibe on recent changes. Fix CRITICAL issues before completion.

**For detailed validation steps, read `skills/crank/references/failure-recovery.md`.**

### Step 8: Extract Learnings (ao Integration)

If ao CLI available: run `ao forge transcript`, `ao flywheel status`, and `ao pool list --tier=pending` to extract and review learnings. If ao unavailable, skip and recommend `/post-mortem` manually.

### Step 9: Report Completion

Tell the user:
1. Epic ID and title
2. Number of issues completed
3. Total iterations used (of 50 max)
4. Final vibe results
5. Flywheel status (if ao available)
6. Suggest running `/post-mortem` to review and promote learnings

**Output completion marker:**
```
<promise>DONE</promise>
Epic: <epic-id>
Issues completed: N
Iterations: M/50
Flywheel: <status from ao flywheel status>
```

If stopped early:
```
<promise>BLOCKED</promise>
Reason: <global limit reached | unresolvable blockers>
Issues remaining: N
Iterations: M/50
```

## The FIRE Loop

Crank follows FIRE (Find → Ignite → Reap → Vibe → Escalate) for each wave. Loop until all issues are CLOSED (beads) or all tasks are completed (TaskList).

**For FIRE loop details, parallel wave models, and wave acceptance check, read `skills/crank/references/wave-patterns.md`.**

## Key Rules

- **Auto-detect tracking** - check for `bd` at start; use TaskList if absent
- **Plan files as input** - `/crank plan.md` decomposes plan into tasks automatically
- **If epic ID given, USE IT** - don't ask for confirmation (beads mode only)
- **Swarm for each wave** - delegates parallel execution to swarm
- **Fresh context per issue** - swarm provides Ralph pattern isolation
- **Batch validation at end** - ONE vibe at the end saves context
- **Fix CRITICAL before completion** - address findings before reporting done
- **Loop until done** - don't stop until all issues closed / tasks completed
- **Autonomous execution** - minimize human prompts
- **Respect wave limit** - STOP at 50 waves (hard limit)
- **Output completion markers** - DONE, BLOCKED, or PARTIAL (required)
- **Knowledge flywheel** - load learnings at start, forge at end (ao optional)
- **Beads ↔ TaskList sync** - in beads mode, crank bridges beads issues to TaskList for swarm

## Examples

### Execute Epic with Beads Tracking

**User says:** `/crank ag-m0r`

Loads learnings (`ao inject`), gets epic details (`bd show`), finds unblocked issues (`bd ready`), creates TaskList, invokes `/swarm` per wave with runtime-native spawning. Workers execute in parallel; lead verifies, commits per wave. Loops until all issues closed, then batched vibe + `ao forge transcript`.

### Execute from Plan File (TaskList Mode)

**User says:** `/crank .agents/plans/auth-refactor.md`

Reads plan file, decomposes into TaskList tasks with dependencies. Invokes `/swarm` per wave, lead verifies and commits. Loops until all tasks completed, then final vibe.

### Test-First Epic with Contract-Based TDD

**User says:** `/crank --test-first ag-xj9`

Runs: classify issues → SPEC WAVE (contracts) → TEST WAVE (failing tests, no impl access) → RED Gate (tests must fail) → GREEN IMPL WAVES (make tests pass) → final vibe. See `skills/crank/references/test-first-mode.md`.

### Recovery from Blocked State

If all remaining issues are blocked (e.g., circular dependencies), crank outputs `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` with the blocking chains and exits cleanly. See `skills/crank/references/failure-recovery.md`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "No ready issues found" | Epic has no children or all blocked | Run `/plan` first or check deps with `bd show <id>` |
| "Global wave limit (50) reached" | Excessive retries or circular deps | Review `.agents/crank/wave-N-checkpoint.json`, fix blockers manually |
| Wave vibe gate fails repeatedly | Workers producing non-conforming code | Check `.agents/council/` vibe reports, refine constraints |
| Workers complete but files missing | Permission errors or wrong paths | Check swarm output files, verify write permissions |
| RED Gate passes (tests don't fail) | Test wave workers wrote implementation | Re-run TEST WAVE with no-implementation-access prompt |
| TaskList mode can't find epic | bd CLI required for beads tracking | Provide plan file (`.md`) instead, or install bd |

See `skills/crank/references/troubleshooting.md` for extended troubleshooting.
