# Failure Recovery

## Validation Failure Handling

**On swarm validation failure:**

1. Do NOT close the beads issue
2. Add failure context:
   ```bash
   bd comments add <issue-id> "Validation failed: <reason>. Retrying..." 2>/dev/null
   ```
3. Re-add to next wave
4. After 3 failures, escalate:
   ```bash
   bd update <issue-id> --labels BLOCKER 2>/dev/null
   bd comments add <issue-id> "ESCALATED: 3 validation failures. Human review required." 2>/dev/null
   ```

## Wave Limit Enforcement

```bash
# CHECK GLOBAL LIMIT before each wave
if [[ $wave -ge 50 ]]; then
    echo "<promise>BLOCKED</promise>"
    echo "Global wave limit (50) reached. Remaining issues:"
    # Beads mode: bd children <epic-id> --status open
    # TaskList mode: TaskList() → pending tasks
    # STOP - do not continue
fi
```

## Pre-flight Check: Issues Exist

**Verify there are issues to work on:**

**If 0 ready issues found (beads mode) or 0 pending unblocked tasks (TaskList mode):**
```
STOP and return error:
  "No ready issues found for this epic. Either:
   - All issues are blocked (check dependencies)
   - Epic has no child issues (run /plan first)
   - All issues already completed"
```

Also verify: epic has at least 1 child issue total. An epic with 0 children means /plan was not run.

Do NOT proceed with empty issue list - this produces false "epic complete" status.

## Final Batched Validation

When all issues complete, check whether a full /vibe is needed:

```bash
# Check wave checkpoint verdicts — skip final vibe if ALL waves passed clean
ALL_PASS=true
for checkpoint in .agents/crank/wave-*-checkpoint.json; do
    verdict=$(jq -r '.acceptance_verdict // "UNKNOWN"' "$checkpoint" 2>/dev/null)
    if [[ "$verdict" != "PASS" ]]; then
        ALL_PASS=false
        break
    fi
done
```

**If ALL waves passed acceptance check with PASS verdict (no WARNs, no retries):**
Skip the final /vibe — per-wave acceptance checks already validated acceptance criteria. Proceed directly to Step 8 (learnings extraction).

**If ANY wave had WARN, FAIL, or missing verdicts:**
Run ONE comprehensive vibe on recent changes:

```bash
# Get list of changed files from recent commits
git diff --name-only HEAD~10 2>/dev/null | sort -u
```

```
Tool: Skill
Parameters:
  skill: "agentops:vibe"
  args: "recent"
```

**If CRITICAL issues found:**
1. Fix them
2. Re-run vibe on affected files
3. Only proceed to completion when clean

## Retry Strategy

| Failure Type | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Validation failure | Re-add to next wave (max 3 attempts) |
| Blocked dependencies | Escalate after 3 checks |
| Context exhaustion (distributed) | Checkpoint + spawn replacement |
| Build failure | Re-add to retry queue |
| Spec impossible | Mark blocked, escalate immediately |

## Escalation

When issues cannot be resolved automatically:
- Mark with BLOCKER label (beads mode)
- Output `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` with reason
- List remaining issues for human review
