# Agent Prompts

## Judge Agent Prompt -- Default (Independent, No Perspectives)

Used when no `--preset` or `--perspectives` flag is provided:

```
You are Council Judge {N}. You are one of {TOTAL} independent judges evaluating the same target.
You are a teammate on team "{TEAM_NAME}".

{JSON_PACKET}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the target thoroughly
2. Write your FULL analysis to: .agents/council/{OUTPUT_FILENAME}
   - Start with a JSON code block matching the output_schema
   - Follow with Markdown explanation
   - ALL detailed findings, reasoning, and recommendations go in this file
3. Send a SHORT completion signal to the team lead (see format below)
4. You may receive follow-up messages (e.g., debate round 2). Process and respond.

Your job is to find problems. A PASS with caveats is less valuable than a specific FAIL.

For every finding, include these structured remediation fields:
- fix: Specific action to resolve this finding
- why: Root cause or rationale
- ref: File path, spec anchor, or doc reference that supports this finding

CONTEXT BUDGET: Your message to the team lead must be MINIMAL to avoid exploding
the lead's context window. Send ONLY the completion signal below — the lead reads
your full analysis from the output file.

Your message MUST be exactly this JSON block and nothing else:

\`\`\`json
{
  "type": "verdict",
  "verdict": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
  "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "file": ".agents/council/{OUTPUT_FILENAME}"
}
\`\`\`

Do NOT include key_insight, findings, or explanation in the message.
Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON block.
The lead reads your output file for all details.

Rules:
- Do NOT message other judges -- all communication through team lead
- Do NOT access shared task state -- lead manages coordination
- Keep messages to lead MINIMAL -- file has the details
```

## Judge Agent Prompt -- With Perspectives (Preset or Custom)

Used when `--preset` or `--perspectives` flag is provided. When using a preset with named personas, the persona name replaces the generic "Council Member N" label via `{PERSONA_NAME}`. For custom perspectives without names, `{PERSONA_NAME}` falls back to `Council Member {N}`.

```
You are **{PERSONA_NAME}**, the {PERSPECTIVE} judge.
You are a teammate on team "{TEAM_NAME}".

{JSON_PACKET}

Your angle: {PERSPECTIVE_DESCRIPTION}

For every finding, include these structured remediation fields:
- fix: Specific action to resolve this finding
- why: Root cause or rationale
- ref: File path, spec anchor, or doc reference that supports this finding

Instructions:
1. Analyze the target from your perspective
2. Write your FULL analysis to: .agents/council/{OUTPUT_FILENAME}
   - Start with a JSON code block matching the output_schema
   - Follow with Markdown explanation
   - ALL detailed findings, reasoning, and recommendations go in this file
3. Send a SHORT completion signal to the team lead (see format below)
4. You may receive follow-up messages (e.g., debate round 2). Process and respond.

CONTEXT BUDGET: Your message to the team lead must be MINIMAL to avoid exploding
the lead's context window. Send ONLY the completion signal below — the lead reads
your full analysis from the output file.

Your message MUST be exactly this JSON block and nothing else:

\`\`\`json
{
  "type": "verdict",
  "verdict": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
  "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "file": ".agents/council/{OUTPUT_FILENAME}"
}
\`\`\`

Do NOT include key_insight, findings, or explanation in the message.
Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON block.
The lead reads your output file for all details.

Rules:
- Do NOT message other judges -- all communication through team lead
- Do NOT access shared task state -- lead manages coordination
- Keep messages to lead MINIMAL -- file has the details
```

## Debate Round 2 Message (via agent messaging)

When `--debate` is active, the team lead sends this message to each judge after R1 completes. The judge already has its own R1 analysis in context (no truncation needed).

```
## Debate Round 2

## Anti-Anchoring Protocol

Before reviewing other judges' verdicts:

1. **RESTATE your R1 position** -- Write 2-3 sentences summarizing your own R1 verdict
   and the key evidence that led to it. This anchors you to YOUR OWN reasoning before
   exposure to others.

2. **Then review other verdicts** -- Only after restating your position, read the
   other judges' JSON verdicts below.

3. **Evidence bar for changing verdict** -- You may only change your verdict if you can
   cite a SPECIFIC technical detail, code location, or factual error that you missed
   in R1. "Judge 2 made a good point" is NOT sufficient. "Judge 2 found an unchecked
   error path at auth.py:45 that I missed" IS sufficient.

Other judges' R1 verdicts (SUMMARY ONLY — read their output files for full analysis):

### {OTHER_JUDGE_PERSPECTIVE}
Verdict: {VERDICT_VALUE} | Confidence: {CONFIDENCE} | File: {R1_OUTPUT_FILE}
(repeat for each other judge)

To review a judge's full reasoning, read their output file listed above.

## Debate Instructions

You MUST follow this structure:

**IF judges disagreed in R1 (different verdicts):**

1. **STEEL-MAN**: State the strongest version of an argument from another
   judge that you initially disagree with. Show you understand it fully
   before responding to it.

2. **CHALLENGE**: Identify at least one specific claim from another judge
   that you believe is wrong or incomplete. Cite evidence.

3. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: Identify at least one point from another judge that
   strengthens, modifies, or adds to your analysis.

4. **REVISE OR CONFIRM**: State your final verdict with specific reasoning.
   If changing from R1, explain exactly what new evidence changed your mind.
   If confirming, explain why the opposing arguments did not persuade you.

**IF all judges agreed in R1 (same verdict):**

Do NOT invent disagreement. Instead, stress-test the consensus:

1. **DEVIL'S ADVOCATE**: What is the strongest argument AGAINST the consensus?
2. **BLIND SPOT**: What perspective or risk did all judges overlook?
3. **CONFIRM OR REVISE**: Does the consensus hold under scrutiny?

Do NOT change your verdict merely because others disagree.
Do NOT defensively maintain without engaging with opposing arguments.

Write revised verdict to: .agents/council/{R2_OUTPUT_FILENAME}
Include "debate_notes" field in your JSON.

CONTEXT BUDGET: After writing your R2 file, send the SAME minimal completion signal
as R1 — verdict, confidence, file path only. No prose, no findings in the message.

\`\`\`json
{
  "type": "verdict",
  "verdict": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
  "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "file": ".agents/council/{R2_OUTPUT_FILENAME}"
}
\`\`\`

Required JSON format for the OUTPUT FILE (not the message):

{
  "verdict": "PASS | WARN | FAIL",
  "confidence": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "key_insight": "...",
  "findings": [...],
  "recommendation": "...",
  "debate_notes": {
    "revised_from": "original verdict if changed, or null if unchanged",
    "steel_man": "strongest opposing argument I considered",
    "challenges": [
      {
        "target_judge": "judge-2",
        "claim": "what they claimed",
        "response": "why I agree or disagree"
      }
    ],
    "acknowledgments": [
      {
        "source_judge": "judge-1",
        "point": "what they found",
        "impact": "how it affected my analysis"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Then provide a Markdown explanation of your debate reasoning.
```

## Brainstorm Technique Injection

When `--technique` is specified, inject the technique's prompt template into each judge's instructions BEFORE the standard brainstorm prompt. The technique prompt is loaded from `references/brainstorm-techniques.md`.

Template:
```
{TECHNIQUE_PROMPT_INJECTION}

In addition to the technique framework above, also provide your independent creative analysis.
```

If `--technique` is used with a non-brainstorm task type (validate, research), exit with error: "Error: --technique is only applicable to brainstorm mode." This matches the --quick/--debate incompatibility pattern.

## Consolidation Prompt

**Codex output format note:** When Codex judges used `--output-schema`, their output files are pure JSON (`.json` extension) conforming to `skills/council/schemas/verdict.json`. Parse directly with JSON. When fallback was used, output files are markdown (`.md` extension) with a JSON code block that must be extracted (current behavior). Check file extension to determine parse strategy.

The consolidation phase runs as the TEAM LEAD (this agent), NOT as a separate spawned agent.
This avoids creating yet another context window. The lead reads each judge's output file
directly using the Read tool, then synthesizes inline.

**Consolidation procedure:**

1. Collect the list of judge output files from their completion signals
2. Read each file with the Read tool (one file at a time to manage context)
3. Extract the JSON verdict block from each file
4. Synthesize the final report

When synthesizing, follow these guidelines. When judges have persona names (from presets), use those names in attribution (e.g., "**Red** (attacker) found...") instead of generic "Judge 1" labels.

Ensure all consolidated findings have fix/why/ref populated. If a judge omitted these fields, infer them from the judge's analysis. Use fallbacks:
- fix = finding.fix || finding.recommendation || "No fix specified"
- why = finding.why || "No root cause specified"
- ref = finding.ref || finding.location || "No reference"

For validate mode:
1. **Consensus Verdict**: PASS if all PASS, FAIL if any FAIL, else WARN
2. **Shared Findings**: Points all judges agree on
3. **Disagreements**: Where judges differ (with attribution)
4. **Cross-Vendor Insights**: (if --mixed) Unique findings per vendor
5. **Final Recommendation**: Concrete next step

For brainstorm mode:
1. **Options Explored**: Each option with multi-perspective assessment
2. **Trade-offs**: Pros/cons matrix
3. **Recommendation**: Synthesized best approach

For research mode:
1. **Facets Explored**: What each judge investigated
2. **Synthesized Findings**: Merged findings organized by theme
3. **Open Questions**: What remains unknown
4. **Recommendation**: Next steps for further investigation or action

Output format: Markdown report for human consumption.

## Consolidation Prompt -- Debate Additions

When `--debate` is used, append this to the consolidation prompt:

```
## Additional Instructions (Debate Mode)

You have received TWO rounds of judge reports.

Round 1 (independent assessment): Each judge evaluated independently.
Round 2 (post-debate revision): Each judge reviewed all other judges' findings and revised.

When synthesizing:
1. Use Round 2 verdicts for the CONSENSUS VERDICT computation (PASS/WARN/FAIL)
2. Use Round 1 verdicts for FINDING COMPLETENESS -- a finding in R1 but dropped in R2 without explanation deserves mention
3. Compare R1 and R2 to identify position shifts
4. Flag judges who changed verdict without citing a specific technical detail, a misinterpretation they corrected, or a finding they missed (possible anchoring)
   Flag judges who changed verdict without citing:
   - A specific file:line or code location
   - A factual error in their R1 analysis
   - A missing test case or edge case
   These are "weak flips" -- potential anchoring, not genuine persuasion.
5. If R1 had at least 2 judges with different verdicts AND R2 is unanimous, note "Convergence detected -- review reasoning for anchoring risk"
6. In the report, include the Verdict Shifts table showing R1->R2 changes per judge
7. Detect whether debate ran via native teams (judges stayed alive between rounds) or fallback (R2 judges were re-spawned with truncated R1 verdicts). Include the `**Fidelity:**` field in the report header: "full" for native teams, "degraded" for fallback.

When a Round 2 verdict is unavailable (timeout fallback):
- Read the full R1 output file (.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-{perspective}.md)
- Extract the JSON verdict block (first JSON code block in the file)
- Use this as the judge's verdict for consolidation
- Mark in report: "Judge {perspective}: R1 verdict (R2 timeout)"
```
