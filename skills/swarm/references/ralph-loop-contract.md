# Ralph Loop Contract (Reverse-Engineered)

This contract captures the operational Ralph mechanics reverse-engineered from:
- `https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum`
- `.tmp/how-to-ralph-wiggum/README.md`
- `.tmp/how-to-ralph-wiggum/files/loop.sh`
- `.tmp/how-to-ralph-wiggum/files/PROMPT_plan.md`
- `.tmp/how-to-ralph-wiggum/files/PROMPT_build.md`

Use this as the source-of-truth for Ralph alignment in AgentOps orchestration skills.

## Core Contract

1. Fresh context every iteration/wave.
- Each execution unit starts clean; no carryover worker memory.

2. Scheduler-heavy, worker-light.
- The lead/orchestrator schedules and reconciles.
- Workers perform one scoped unit of work.

3. Disk-backed shared state.
- Loop continuity comes from filesystem state, not accumulated chat context.
- In classic Ralph: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

4. One-task atomicity.
- Select one important task, execute, validate, persist state, then restart fresh.

5. Backpressure before completion.
- Build/tests/lint/gates must reject bad output before task completion/commit.

6. Observe and tune outside the loop.
- Humans (or lead agents) monitor outcomes and adjust prompts/constraints/contracts.

## AgentOps Mapping

| Ralph concept | AgentOps implementation |
|---|---|
| Fresh context per loop | New workers/teams per wave in `/swarm`; fresh phase context in `ao rpi phased` |
| Main context as scheduler | Mayor/lead orchestration in `/swarm` and `/crank` |
| Plan file as state | `bd` issue graph, TaskList state, plan artifacts in `.agents/plans/` |
| One task per pass | One issue per worker assignment in swarm/crank waves |
| Backpressure | `/vibe`, task validation hooks, tests/lint gates, push/pre-mortem gates |
| Outer loop restart | Wave loop in `/crank`; phase loop in `ao rpi phased` |

## Implementation Notes

- Keep worker prompts concise and operational.
- Keep state in files/issue trackers, not long conversational memory.
- Prefer deterministic checks over subjective completion.
