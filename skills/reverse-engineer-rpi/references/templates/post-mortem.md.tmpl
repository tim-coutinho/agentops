# Post-Mortem: {{PRODUCT_NAME}}

- Date: {{DATE}}
- Output dir: `{{OUTPUT_DIR}}`

## What Worked

- Docs sitemap inventory (when available) produced a mechanically checkable slug set.
- Registry-first mapping kept claims grounded.

## What Didn’t

- Any parts that relied only on strings/symbol heuristics without anchors.

## Follow-Ups

- Add anchors for key feature groups.
- Add a safe fuzz harness (only if already present).
