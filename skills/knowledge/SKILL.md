# Knowledge Skill

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

Find and retrieve knowledge from past work.

## Execution Steps

Given `/knowledge <query>`:

### Step 1: Search with ao CLI (if available)

```bash
ao search "<query>" --limit 10 2>/dev/null
```

If results found, read the relevant files.

### Step 2: Search .agents/ Directory

```bash
# Search learnings
grep -r "<query>" .agents/learnings/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Search patterns
grep -r "<query>" .agents/patterns/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Search research
grep -r "<query>" .agents/research/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Search retros
grep -r "<query>" .agents/retros/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

### Step 3: Search Plans

```bash
# Local plans
grep -r "<query>" .agents/plans/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Global plans
grep -r "<query>" ~/.claude/plans/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

### Step 3.5: Search Global Patterns

```bash
# Global patterns (cross-repo knowledge)
grep -r "<query>" ~/.claude/patterns/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Global patterns contain knowledge promoted from any repository via `/learn --global`. These are high-confidence, cross-project learnings.

### Step 4: Use Semantic Search (if MCP available)

```
Tool: mcp__smart-connections-work__lookup
Parameters:
  query: "<query>"
  limit: 10
```

### Step 5: Read Relevant Files

For each match found, use the Read tool to get full content.

### Step 6: Synthesize Results

Combine findings into a coherent response:
- What do we know about this topic?
- What learnings are relevant?
- What patterns apply?
- What past decisions were made?

### Step 7: Report to User

Present the knowledge found:
1. Summary of findings
2. Key learnings (with IDs)
3. Relevant patterns
4. Links to source files
5. Confidence level (how much we know)

## Knowledge Locations

| Type | Location | Format |
|------|----------|--------|
| Learnings | `.agents/learnings/` | Markdown |
| Patterns | `.agents/patterns/` | Markdown |
| Research | `.agents/research/` | Markdown |
| Retros | `.agents/retros/` | Markdown |
| Plans | `.agents/plans/` | Markdown |
| Global Plans | `~/.claude/plans/` | Markdown |
| Global Patterns | `~/.claude/patterns/` | Cross-repo reusable knowledge |

## Key Rules

- **Search multiple locations** - knowledge may be scattered
- **Use ao CLI first** - semantic search is better
- **Fall back to grep** - if ao not available
- **Read full files** - don't just report matches
- **Synthesize** - combine findings into useful answer

## Example Queries

```bash
/knowledge authentication    # Find auth-related learnings
/knowledge "rate limiting"   # Find rate limit patterns
/knowledge kubernetes        # Find K8s knowledge
/knowledge "what do we know about caching"
```

## Examples

### Finding Past Learnings

**User says:** `/knowledge "error handling patterns"`

**What happens:**
1. Agent tries `ao search "error handling patterns"`, finds 3 matches
2. Agent searches `.agents/learnings/` with grep, finds 5 additional matches
3. Agent searches `.agents/patterns/` for related patterns, finds 2 matches
4. Agent reads all matched files using Read tool
5. Agent synthesizes findings into coherent response
6. Agent reports: "We have 5 learnings about error handling: L1 (always wrap errors), L3 (use typed errors), L12 (log before returning), L15 (context propagation), L22 (retry with backoff)"
7. Agent provides links to source files and confidence level: high (multiple confirmations)

**Result:** Complete knowledge synthesis with 5 specific learnings and 2 related patterns, all with source citations.

### Querying Without ao CLI

**User says:** `/knowledge "database migrations"`

**What happens:**
1. Agent tries `ao search`, command not found
2. Agent falls back to grep search across `.agents/` directories
3. Agent finds 2 matches in learnings, 1 in research, 0 in patterns
4. Agent reads matched files
5. Agent synthesizes: "Limited knowledge found. L8 recommends using transaction-wrapped migrations. Research doc from 2026-01-20 analyzed migration tools."
6. Agent reports medium confidence (only 2 sources)

**Result:** Knowledge found despite missing ao CLI, with appropriate confidence level based on source count.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| No results found | Query too specific or knowledge not yet captured | Broaden search terms. Try synonyms. Check if topic was covered in recent work but retro not yet run. Suggest running `/retro` to extract recent learnings. |
| Too many results (overwhelming) | Very broad query term | Narrow query with more specific terms. Filter by date: search only recent learnings. Use semantic search (ao CLI) for better ranking if available. |
| Results lack context | Grep matches found but files don't address query | Read full files, not just matching lines. Synthesize from surrounding context. May need to trace back to original research with `/trace`. |
| Confidence level unclear | Mixed or contradictory sources | Report conflicting information explicitly. Note which sources agree/disagree. Suggest running `/research` to investigate further if critical. |
