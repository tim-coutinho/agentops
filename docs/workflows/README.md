## Workflows

### [Quick Fix](quick-fix.md)
**When to use:** Simple, low-risk changes to 1-2 files with an obvious solution.
**Complexity:** Low (10-30 min, single session)
**Key skills:** /implement

### [Debug Cycle](debug-cycle.md)
**When to use:** Production incidents, intermittent failures, performance issues, or integration bugs with unknown root cause.
**Complexity:** Medium-High (1-3 hours, 1-3 sessions)
**Key skills:** /bug-hunt, /implement, /retro

### [Complete Cycle](complete-cycle.md)
**When to use:** New features, complex multi-file changes, or architectural work that needs full Research-Plan-Implement-Validate-Learn phases.
**Complexity:** High (2-4 hours, 2-4 sessions)
**Key skills:** /research, /plan, /crank, /vibe, /retro

### [Infrastructure Deployment](infrastructure-deployment.md)
**When to use:** Infrastructure deployments that need validation gates, reality checks, and tracer bullets at every phase.
**Complexity:** High (multi-session)
**Key skills:** /plan, /implement, /vibe

### [Multi-Domain](multi-domain.md)
**When to use:** Work spanning multiple domains simultaneously (backend + frontend + infra, technical + personal tracking).
**Complexity:** High (multi-session)
**Key skills:** /plan, /swarm

### [Assumption Validation](assumption-validation.md)
**When to use:** Before planning, to verify that research findings match reality (APIs exist, images available, operators behave as expected).
**Complexity:** Medium
**Key skills:** /research

### [Knowledge Synthesis](knowledge-synthesis.md)
**When to use:** Onboarding to a new codebase, creating comprehensive docs, extracting patterns from multiple implementations.
**Complexity:** Medium (30-60 min, single session)
**Key skills:** /research, /knowledge

### [Post-Work Retro](post-work-retro.md)
**When to use:** After completing significant work, to capture learnings and identify improvements.
**Complexity:** Low
**Key skills:** /retro, /post-mortem

### [Continuous Improvement](continuous-improvement.md)
**When to use:** Periodic reviews (weekly/monthly), after milestones, technical debt reduction, or pattern refinement.
**Complexity:** Medium (ongoing, periodic)
**Key skills:** /retro, /vibe

### [Session Lifecycle](session-lifecycle.md)
**When to use:** Managing any working session from start to finish -- starting work, resuming context, wrapping up.
**Complexity:** Low (use natural language)
**Key skills:** Just talk naturally; commands are optional.

### [Meta-Observer Pattern](meta-observer-pattern.md)
**When to use:** Coordinating N autonomous workers through shared memory (stigmergy) without central orchestration.
**Complexity:** High (advanced, multi-session)
**Key skills:** /swarm
**Deep dive:** [meta-observer/](meta-observer/) (pattern guide, examples, showcase)
