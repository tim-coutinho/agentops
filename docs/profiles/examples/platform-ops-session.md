## Session Flow

### 1. Incident Detection (5 min)

```
User: Alert: High error rate on order-service
```

**Skills loaded**: operations

**Immediate Actions**:
- Assess severity (P1 - major functionality)
- Check user impact (orders failing)
- Start incident timeline

### 2. Investigation (15 min)

```
User: Investigate the error spike
```

**Skills loaded**: operations, monitoring

**Actions**:
- Check error logs for patterns
- Review recent deployments
- Analyze metrics dashboards
- Identify root cause hypothesis

**Findings**:
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Started after 10am traffic spike
- Pool sized for normal load, not peak

### 3. Mitigation (10 min)

```
User: Fix the connection pool issue
```

**Skills loaded**: operations, validation

**Actions**:
- Increase connection pool size
- Deploy configuration change
- Monitor recovery
- Validate tracer request succeeds

**Result**: Error rate back to normal

---

### 4. Documentation (10 min)

```
User: Document this incident
```

**Skills loaded**: meta

**Actions**:
- Create incident timeline
- Document root cause
- Write action items

**Actions**:
- Add connection pool utilization alert
- Link to new runbook
- Set appropriate threshold
