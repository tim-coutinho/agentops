# DevOps for Vibe-Coding

**Version:** 1.2.0
**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Foundation document for strategic pivot

## Tagline

**Primary:** The missing DevOps layer for coding agents. Flow, feedback, and memory that compounds between sessions.

**Secondary:** Validation Built In, Not Bolted On

**Category:** DevOps for coding agents

**Legacy (SEO/blog only):** DevOps for Vibe-Coding

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> 12-Factor AgentOps is DevOps for vibe-coding. Instead of waiting for CI to catch problems with AI-generated code, we shift validation left—into the workflow itself. Pre-mortem before you implement. Vibe check before you commit. The same operational discipline that made infrastructure reliable, applied to coding agents.

### One-Liner (10 seconds)

> Shift-left validation for coding agents—catch it before you ship it.

### Tweet-Length (280 chars)

> DevOps gave us reliable infrastructure. 12-Factor AgentOps gives us reliable coding agents. Validation built in, not bolted on. Pre-mortem before build. Vibe check before commit. Knowledge that compounds.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Validation Built In, Not Bolted On

**Traditional workflow:**
```
Write code → Ship → CI catches problems → Fix → Repeat
```

**Shift-left workflow:**
```
/pre-mortem → Implement → /vibe → Commit → Knowledge compounds
```

The validation loop happens BEFORE code ships, not after. This is the core insight.

### 2. Coding Agent Specific

We focus on **coding agents**—AI assistants that write, modify, and review code:

- Claude Code running in terminal/IDE
- AI pair programming sessions
- Code generation with validation workflows
- Agents using Read, Edit, Write, Bash for development

We are NOT:
- A framework for customer service chatbots
- A platform for RAG-based Q&A systems
- An SDK for multi-modal agents
- A solution for general autonomous production agents

### 3. DevOps Principles, New Context

We apply proven operational discipline to a new domain:

| DevOps Principle | Coding Agent Application |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Infrastructure as Code | Prompts and workflows as versioned artifacts |
| Shift-Left Testing | /pre-mortem before implementation |
| Continuous Integration | /vibe checks before every commit |
| Post-Mortems | /retro to extract and compound learnings |
| Observability | Knowledge flywheel tracks what works |

### 4. Single-Session Excellence

AgentOps optimizes the single coding session—where most value is created or destroyed:

- Context management (40% rule)
- Validation gates within the session
- Knowledge extraction and injection
- Human-AI collaboration patterns

For multi-session orchestration, see Olympus (Temporal-based workflows).

### 5. Knowledge That Compounds

The Knowledge Flywheel:
```
Session → Forge (extract learnings) → Pool (validate) → Inject (apply)
    ↑____________________________________________________________|
```

Every session makes the next one better. This is the moat.

## What We Are

- **DevOps principles applied to coding agents** — The same operational discipline that made infrastructure reliable
- **Validation-first workflow** — Shift-left, not shift-blame
- **Knowledge flywheel that compounds** — Learnings persist and improve future sessions
- **Single-session orchestration** — Excellence where it matters most
- **Framework, not SDK** — Patterns and practices, not lock-in

## What We Are NOT

- **General production agent framework** — For that, see [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) by Dex Horthy
- **Just another automation tool** — We're about validation, not execution speed
- **Competing with Agent SDKs** — We're complementary (use LangChain, CrewAI, etc. for the runtime)
- **Model-specific** — Works with Claude, could work with others
- **Multi-session orchestration** — For that, see Olympus

## Target Audience

### Primary: Developers Using Coding Agents

- Engineers using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or similar
- Teams adopting AI-assisted development
- Developers who want "vibe coding" without the "hope and pray"

### Secondary: Engineering Managers

- Teams scaling AI-assisted development
- Leaders concerned about code quality with AI
- Organizations building coding agent workflows

### Tertiary: Platform/DevOps Engineers

- Building internal developer platforms with AI
- Integrating coding agents into CI/CD
- Establishing validation patterns for AI-generated code

## Competitive Positioning

| Solution | Focus | Relationship to Us |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **12-Factor Agents** (Dex Horthy) | General autonomous agents | Complementary—we're coding-specific |
| **Agent SDKs** (LangChain, CrewAI) | Runtime infrastructure | We sit above—validation patterns, not execution |
| **Olympus** (mt-olympus.io) | Multi-session orchestration | Complementary—we're single-session |
| **CI/CD tools** | Post-merge validation | We shift-left—validation before commit |
| **Linters/Formatters** | Syntax validation | We're semantic—does the code do what you intended? |

## Core Message Framework

### When Asked "What is 12-Factor AgentOps?"

> It's DevOps for vibe-coding. We apply the same operational principles that made infrastructure reliable—shift-left testing, post-mortems, continuous validation—to coding agents. Instead of shipping AI-generated code and hoping CI catches problems, you validate before you commit.

### When Asked "How is it different from X?"

| X | Response |
|---|----------|
| Regular coding | Same principles, but with AI-specific patterns for context management and validation |
| Other agent frameworks | We're coding-specific and validation-focused, not general autonomous agents |
| CI/CD | We shift validation left—into the workflow, before you push |
| Copilot/Claude Code | We're complementary—the operational layer around your coding agent |

### When Asked "Why should I care?"

> Because AI-generated code still needs validation. The 80% that works is valuable. The 20% that doesn't can be catastrophic. DevOps taught us to shift validation left. AgentOps applies that to coding agents.

## Key Phrases Reference

### Use These

- "DevOps for Vibe-Coding"
- "Shift-left validation for coding agents"
- "Validation built in, not bolted on"
- "Catch it before you ship it"
- "Knowledge that compounds"
- "The 40% rule" (context budget)
- "Pre-mortem before implement"
- "Vibe check before commit"

### Avoid These

- "Operational principles for reliable AI agents" (old, too general)
- "Production-grade agents" (implies general agents)
- "AI-assisted development" (too generic, no validation emphasis)
- "Autonomous agents" (not our focus)
- "Just use Claude better" (undersells the framework)

## The Three Core Skills

The shift-left workflow expressed as skills:

### 1. /pre-mortem — Simulate Failures Before Implementing

> "What could go wrong with this plan?"

Run BEFORE implementing. Identifies risks, missing requirements, edge cases. The validation starts before code exists.

### 2. /vibe — Validate Before You Commit

> "Does this code do what you intended?"

The semantic vibe check. Not just syntax—does the implementation match the intent? Run BEFORE every commit.

### 3. /retro — Extract Learnings to Compound Knowledge

> "What did we learn that makes the next session better?"

Closes the loop. Extracts learnings, feeds the flywheel. Every session makes the next one better.

**Supporting skills:** /research (understand before acting), /plan (think before implementing), /crank (execute with validation gates)

---

## Success Criteria

This positioning is successful when:

1. **Users can state what we do in one sentence** — "DevOps for vibe-coding" or equivalent
2. **No confusion with general agent frameworks** — Clear we're coding-specific
3. **Validation emphasis is clear** — Shift-left, not shift-blame
4. **Knowledge flywheel is understood** — Sessions compound, not isolated
