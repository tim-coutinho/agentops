# L1 — Basics

Single-session work with Claude Code. The gateway level.

## What You'll Learn

- Using `/research` to explore a codebase
- Using `/implement` to make changes
- Basic git workflow with Claude Code
- Reading existing code before making changes

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Git repository initialized
- No prior AgentOps experience required

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/research <topic>` | Explore codebase, understand patterns |
| `/implement` | Make targeted changes |

## Key Concepts

- **Single session**: All work happens in one conversation
- **No persistence**: Knowledge lives only in the conversation
- **Git-backed**: Changes exist in version control

## What's NOT at This Level

- No `.agents/` directory
- No issue tracking
- No multi-session memory
- No parallelization

## Demo

See the `demo/` directory for real session transcripts.

## Next Level

Once comfortable with single-session work, progress to [L2-persistence](../L2-persistence/) to add cross-session memory.
