# L2 — Persistence

Add the `.agents/` directory for cross-session memory.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating `.agents/` directory structure
- Writing research documents that persist
- Extracting learnings with `/retro`
- Pattern documentation

## Prerequisites

- Completed L1-basics
- Comfortable with `/research` and `/implement`

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/research <topic>` | Output now saved to `.agents/research/` |
| `/implement` | Same as L1 |
| `/retro [topic]` | Extract learnings to `.agents/learnings/` |

## Key Concepts

- **`.agents/` directory**: AI memory system
- **Research documents**: Deep exploration persists
- **Learnings**: Session insights survive context clear
- **Patterns**: Reusable solutions accumulate

## Directory Structure

```
.agents/
├── research/     # Deep exploration documents
├── learnings/    # Session insights
└── patterns/     # Reusable solutions
```

## What's NOT at This Level

- No issue tracking
- No parallelization
- No `/crank` (autonomous execution)

## Next Level

Once comfortable with persistence, progress to [L3-state-management](../L3-state-management/) to add issue tracking.
