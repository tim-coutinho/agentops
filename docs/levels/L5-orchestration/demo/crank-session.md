# Demo: /crank Session

A session showing autonomous epic execution via the ODMCR loop.

---

## Before

Epic created with `/plan`:

```
$ bd show agentops-epic-xyz
Epic: "Add real-time notifications"
Status: open
Children: 6 issues

Issues:
  [P1] agentops-a1: Set up WebSocket server
  [P1] agentops-b2: Create notification service
  [P2] agentops-c3: Add browser client (blocked by a1)
  [P2] agentops-d4: Create notification types (blocked by b2)
  [P2] agentops-e5: Add user preferences (blocked by b2)
  [P3] agentops-f6: Integration tests (blocked by c3, d4, e5)
```

## Mayor Mode (Parallel)

If run from `~/gt` or a mayor directory:

```
You: /crank agentops-epic-xyz

Claude: Loading epic...

**Epic:** Add real-time notifications
**Mode:** mayor (parallel via gastown)
**Issues:** 6 total

[OBSERVE] 2 issues ready (a1, b2)

[DISPATCH] gt sling agentops-a1 athena
[DISPATCH] gt sling agentops-b2 athena

[MONITOR] Convoy status:
  → agentops-a1: in_progress (polecat-1)
  → agentops-b2: in_progress (polecat-2)

[Polecats working in parallel...]

[COLLECT] Both complete
  ✓ agentops-a1 CLOSED
  ✓ agentops-b2 CLOSED

[OBSERVE] 3 issues ready (c3, d4, e5)

[DISPATCH] gt sling agentops-c3 athena
[DISPATCH] gt sling agentops-d4 athena
[DISPATCH] gt sling agentops-e5 athena

...continues until epic CLOSED
```

## What You Learned

1. `/crank` runs the ODMCR loop until epic is CLOSED
2. Auto-detects crew (sequential) vs mayor (parallel) mode
3. NO human prompts - fully autonomous
4. Handles dependencies automatically via beads
5. Integrates with gastown for multi-agent parallelization
