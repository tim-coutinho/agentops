# Glossary

Project-specific terms used throughout AgentOps documentation.

## A

### AgentOps
A skills plugin that turns coding agents into autonomous software engineering systems. Provides the RPI workflow, knowledge flywheel, multi-model validation, and parallel execution — all with local-only state. [Full documentation](../README.md)

### Atomic Work
A unit of work with no shared mutable state with concurrent workers. Pure function model: input (issue spec + codebase snapshot) → output (patch + verification). This isolation property is what enables parallel wave execution — workers cannot interfere with each other. Enforced by fresh context per worker and lead-only commits.

## B

### Beads
Git-native issue tracking system accessed via the `bd` CLI. Issues live in `.beads/` inside your repo and sync through normal git operations — no external service required. [Full documentation](../skills/beads/SKILL.md)

### Brownian Ratchet
The core execution model: spawn parallel agents (chaos), validate their output with a multi-model council (filter), and merge passing results to main (ratchet). Progress locks forward — failed agents are discarded cheaply because fresh context means no contamination. [Full documentation](how-it-works.md#the-brownian-ratchet)

## C

### Codex Team
A skill (`/codex-team`) that spawns parallel Codex (OpenAI) execution agents orchestrated by Claude, enabling cross-vendor parallel task execution. [Full documentation](../skills/codex-team/SKILL.md)

### Council
The core validation primitive. Spawns independent judge agents (Claude and/or Codex) that review work from different perspectives, deliberate, and converge on a verdict: PASS, WARN, or FAIL. Foundation for `/vibe`, `/pre-mortem`, and `/post-mortem`. [Full documentation](../skills/council/SKILL.md)

### Crank
A skill (`/crank`) that executes an epic by spawning parallel worker agents in dependency-ordered waves. Each worker gets fresh context, writes files, and reports back; the lead validates and commits. Runs until every issue in the epic is closed. [Full documentation](../skills/crank/SKILL.md)

## E

### Epic
A group of related issues that together accomplish a goal. Created by `/plan`, executed by `/crank`. Each epic has a dependency graph that determines which issues can run in parallel (same wave) and which must wait (later waves). [Full documentation](SKILLS.md#plan)

### Extract
An internal skill that pulls learnings, patterns, and decisions from session transcripts and artifacts into structured knowledge files. [Full documentation](../skills/extract/SKILL.md)

## F

### FIRE Loop
The reconciliation engine that implements the Brownian Ratchet: **F**ind (read current state), **I**gnite (spawn parallel agents), **R**eap (harvest and validate results), **E**scalate (handle failures and blockers). Used by `/crank` for autonomous epic execution. [Full documentation](brownian-ratchet.md#the-fire-loop)

### Flywheel (Knowledge Flywheel)
The automated loop that extracts learnings from completed work, scores them for quality, and re-injects them at the next session start. Knowledge compounds when retrieval and usage outpace decay and scale friction; otherwise it plateaus until controls improve. [Full documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md#knowledge-flywheel) <!-- NOTE: Ensure ARCHITECTURE.md preserves the #knowledge-flywheel anchor target -->

### Forge
An internal skill that mines session transcripts for knowledge artifacts — decisions, patterns, failures, and fixes — and stores them in `.agents/`. [Full documentation](../skills/forge/SKILL.md)

## G

### Gate
A checkpoint enforced by a hook that blocks progress until a condition is met. For example, the push gate blocks `git push` until `/vibe` has passed, and the pre-mortem gate blocks `/crank` until `/pre-mortem` has passed.

## H

### Handoff
A skill (`/handoff`) that creates structured session handoff documents so another agent or future session can continue work with full context. [Full documentation](../skills/handoff/SKILL.md)

### Hook
A shell script that fires automatically on agent lifecycle events (session start, git push, task completion, etc.). AgentOps includes 12 hooks that enforce workflow rules, inject knowledge, and advance ratchet state. All hooks can be disabled with `AGENTOPS_HOOKS_DISABLED=1`. [Full documentation](../hooks/hooks.json)

## I

### Inject
An internal skill triggered at session start that loads relevant prior knowledge from `.agents/` into the current session context. [Full documentation](../skills/inject/SKILL.md)

### Issue
A discrete unit of trackable work, stored as a bead. Created by `/plan`, executed by `/implement` or `/crank`. Has status, dependencies, and parent/child relationships. [Full documentation](SKILLS.md#beads)

## J

### Judge
An agent in a council that evaluates work from a specific perspective (security, architecture, correctness, etc.). Judges deliberate asynchronously, then the lead consolidates verdicts. [Full documentation](../skills/council/SKILL.md)

## L

### Level
A learning progression stage (L1-L5) that indicates the maturity of a knowledge artifact, from raw observation to validated organizational knowledge. [Full documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md#knowledge-artifacts)

## O

### Operational Invariant
A cross-cutting rule enforced by hooks that applies to all skills and agents. Examples: workers must not commit (lead-only), push blocked until /vibe passes, pre-mortem required for 3+ issue epics. Invariants are not guidelines — they are mechanically enforced. [Full documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md#operational-invariants)

## P

### Pool
A knowledge quality tier — pending, tempered, or promoted. Artifacts start in pending, get tempered through repeated validation and use, and can be promoted to the permanent knowledge base. [Full documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md#knowledge-artifacts)

### Post-mortem
A skill (`/post-mortem`) that runs after work is complete. Convenes a council to validate the implementation, runs a retro to extract learnings, and suggests the next `/rpi` command to continue the improvement loop. [Full documentation](../skills/post-mortem/SKILL.md)

### Pre-mortem
A skill (`/pre-mortem`) that runs before implementation begins. Judges simulate failures against the plan — including spec-completeness checks — and surface problems while they are still cheap to fix. A FAIL verdict sends the plan back for revision. [Full documentation](../skills/pre-mortem/SKILL.md)

### Profile
A documentation grouping for domain-specific workflows and standards. Profiles organize coding standards and validation rules by language or domain. [Full documentation](../skills/standards/SKILL.md)

### Provenance
An internal skill that traces the lineage and sources of knowledge artifacts — where a learning came from, which sessions produced it, and how it was validated. [Full documentation](../skills/provenance/SKILL.md)

## R

### Ralph Wiggum Pattern (Ralph Loop)
The practice of giving every worker agent a fresh context window instead of letting context accumulate across tasks. Named after the [Ralph Wiggum pattern](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). Each wave spawns new workers with clean context, preventing bleed-through and contamination from prior work. [Full documentation](how-it-works.md#ralph-wiggum-pattern--fresh-context-every-wave)

### Ratchet
A mechanism that locks progress forward so it cannot regress. Once a gate is passed (e.g., vibe validation), the ratchet records that state and hooks enforce it going forward. Combined with the Brownian Ratchet execution model, this ensures quality only moves in one direction. [Full documentation](../skills/ratchet/SKILL.md)

### Research
The first phase of the RPI lifecycle. Deep codebase exploration using Explore agents that produce structured findings in `.agents/research/`. [Full documentation](../skills/research/SKILL.md)

### Retro
A skill (`/retro`) that extracts learnings from completed work — decisions made, patterns discovered, and failures encountered — and feeds them into the knowledge flywheel. Learnings are scored for specificity, actionability, and novelty. [Full documentation](../skills/retro/SKILL.md)

### RPI (Research-Plan-Implement)
The full lifecycle workflow: Research the codebase, Plan by decomposing the goal into issues, then Implement via pre-mortem, crank, vibe, and post-mortem. The `/rpi` skill runs all phases end to end; `ao rpi phased` runs each phase in its own fresh context window. [Full documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-rpi-workflow)

## S

### Skill
A self-contained capability defined by a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter. Skills are the primary unit of functionality in AgentOps — each one has triggers, instructions, and optional reference docs loaded just-in-time. AgentOps ships 51 skills (41 user-facing, 10 internal). [Full documentation](SKILLS.md)

### Swarm
A skill (`/swarm`) that spawns parallel worker agents with fresh context. Each wave gets a new team; the lead validates and commits. Workers never commit directly. [Full documentation](../skills/swarm/SKILL.md)

## T

### Tempered
A knowledge quality state indicating an artifact has been validated through multiple uses across sessions. Tempered knowledge has higher confidence than pending and can be promoted to the permanent knowledge base. [Full documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md#knowledge-artifacts)

## V

### Vibe
A skill (`/vibe`) that validates code after implementation by running a council of judges against the changes. Produces a PASS, WARN, or FAIL verdict. A passing vibe is typically required by the push gate before code can be pushed to the remote. [Full documentation](../skills/vibe/SKILL.md)

## W

### Wave
A batch of issues within an epic that can be executed in parallel because they have no dependencies on each other. Waves are ordered by the dependency graph: Wave 1 contains leaf issues, Wave 2 contains issues that depend on Wave 1, and so on. Each wave spawns fresh worker agents. [Full documentation](../skills/crank/SKILL.md)

### Worker
An agent executing a single task in a swarm. Each worker gets fresh context (no bleed-through from other workers), writes files but never commits — the team lead validates and commits. [Full documentation](../skills/swarm/SKILL.md)
