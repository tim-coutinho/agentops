## At a Glance

| Aspect | Superpowers | AgentOps |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Philosophy** | "Disciplined senior engineer" | "Knowledge compounds over time" |
| **Core strength** | TDD, planning, autonomous hours | Cross-session memory, learning |
| **GitHub stars** | 29,000+ | Growing |
| **Primary use** | Greenfield development | Ongoing codebase work |

## What Superpowers Does Well

### 1. TDD Enforcement
Superpowers enforces true red/green TDD. Write tests first, implement second. No shortcuts.

```
Superpowers TDD Flow:
  Write failing test → Run test (red) → Implement → Run test (green) → Refactor
```

### 2. Planning Mode
The `/superpowers:brainstorm` and `/superpowers:write-plan` commands create structured implementation plans. Claude asks intelligent questions to flesh out details.

### 3. Autonomous Operation
Superpowers can work autonomously for hours without drifting. It spawns subagents for context gathering and uses test suites to validate its work.

### 4. YAGNI/DRY Principles
Built-in enforcement of software engineering best practices. No over-engineering, no repetition.

## Where Superpowers Falls Short

### No Cross-Session Memory

**Superpowers resets every session.** Your agent debugs the same issues repeatedly with no memory of past solutions.

### No Failure Prevention

Superpowers validates *after* implementation (TDD). AgentOps adds *pre-implementation* validation:

```
Superpowers:
  Plan → Implement → Test (catch failures here)

AgentOps:
  Plan → Pre-Mortem (catch failures here) → Implement → Test → Post-Mortem
```

The `/pre-mortem` skill simulates 10 failure scenarios *before* you write code. Cheaper to catch bad designs early.

### Limited Validation Scope

Superpowers relies on your test suite. If tests pass, it's "done."

AgentOps `/vibe` validates 8 aspects beyond tests:
- Semantic correctness (does code match spec?)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code quality / smells
- Architecture violations
- Complexity metrics
- Performance issues
- AI "slop" detection
- Accessibility

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Superpowers | AgentOps | Winner |
|---------|:-----------:|:--------:|:------:|
| TDD enforcement | ✅ Strict | ✅ Supported | Superpowers |
| Planning workflow | ✅ Excellent | ✅ `/plan` + `/pre-mortem` | Tie |
| Subagent spawning | ✅ Built-in | ✅ 20 expert agents | Tie |
| Autonomous work | ✅ Hours | ✅ `/crank` loop | Tie |
| YAGNI/DRY | ✅ Enforced | ⚠️ Via standards | Superpowers |
| **Cross-session memory** | ❌ None | ✅ Git-persisted | **AgentOps** |
| **Knowledge compounding** | ❌ No | ✅ Escape velocity | **AgentOps** |
| **Pre-mortem** | ❌ No | ✅ 10 failure modes | **AgentOps** |
| **8-aspect validation** | ❌ Tests only | ✅ Semantic + security + ... | **AgentOps** |
| **Scientific foundation** | ❌ Best practices | ✅ Peer-reviewed | **AgentOps** |

## Workflow Comparison

### Superpowers Workflow

```
/superpowers:brainstorm  →  Refine requirements interactively
         ↓
/superpowers:write-plan  →  Create implementation plan
         ↓
/superpowers:execute-plan → Execute in batches with TDD
         ↓
       Done
```

### AgentOps Workflow

```
/research     →  Explore codebase + inject prior knowledge
     ↓
/plan         →  Break into tracked issues
     ↓
/pre-mortem   →  Simulate 10 failure modes (BEFORE building)
     ↓
/crank        →  Implement → validate → commit loop
     ↓
/post-mortem  →  Validate + extract learnings (FOR NEXT TIME)
```

**Key difference:** AgentOps has gates *before* and *after* implementation, and learnings persist to future sessions.

## When to Choose Superpowers

- You're doing **greenfield development** (no prior context to leverage)
- You want **strict TDD enforcement** as the primary quality gate
- Your sessions are **independent** (different features each time)
- You prefer a **battle-tested** solution (29K stars, marketplace approved)

## When to Choose AgentOps

- You work on the **same codebase** over many sessions
- You want your agent to **remember past bugs and solutions**
- You want **failure prevention** before building, not just testing after
- You want **semantic validation** beyond just "tests pass"
- You value **compounding knowledge** over time

---

## Can They Work Together?

**Partially.** Both have planning workflows, so you'd need to pick one. But:

- Use Superpowers for TDD enforcement during implementation
- Use AgentOps for cross-session knowledge capture

The overlap is in planning. The differentiation is in memory.

---

## The Bottom Line

| Dimension | Superpowers | AgentOps |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Optimizes** | Quality within session | Learning across sessions |
| **Quality gate** | Tests | 8-aspect semantic validation |
| **Failure catch** | After implementation | Before and after |
| **Knowledge** | Ephemeral | Compounds |

**Superpowers makes Claude a disciplined engineer *today*.**
**AgentOps makes Claude a domain expert *over time*.**
