All notable changes to the AgentOps marketplace will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.15.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Remove stale `ao feedback-loop` and `ao session-outcome` calls from `/post-mortem` skill
- Remove stale `feedback-loop` reference from `/learn` skill flywheel diagram
- Fix `PostToolUse(Read)` reference in cache-eviction doc (now `ao maturity --scan`)
- Remove dead env vars from docs (PRECOMPACT_DISABLED, TASK_VALIDATION_DISABLED, WORKER)
- Remove dead `batch-feedback` check from hook preflight script
- Sync skill counts (52 total, 42 user-facing, 10 internal)

## [2.15.2] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- **Hooks stripped to bare-minimum flywheel** — Reduced from 22 hooks across 12 event types to 3 hooks across 3 events (SessionStart, SessionEnd, Stop). Only knowledge flywheel operations remain: extract, inject, forge, maturity, and close-loop. All safety/feedback/UX hooks removed from registration (scripts preserved for re-enablement).
- **session-start.sh simplified** — 600 lines down to ~100. Removed handoff recovery (3 tiers), ratchet status display, chain.jsonl rotation, environment manifest, prune check, AGENTS.md detection.
- **session-end-maintenance.sh simplified** — Removed session-outcome, feedback-loop, task-sync, batch-feedback, and vibe-check. Kept forge + maturity only.

### Removed

- PreToolUse hooks (standards-injector, skill-lint-gate, git-worker-guard, dangerous-git-guard, pre-mortem-gate)
- PostToolUse hooks (ratchet-advance, citation-tracker)
- UserPromptSubmit hooks (context-guard, prompt-nudge)
- TaskCompleted hook (task-validation-gate)
- PreCompact, SubagentStop, WorktreeCreate, WorktreeRemove, ConfigChange hooks

## [2.15.1] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- **Hook consolidation** — Reduced session startup/shutdown from 14 Go process startups to 4. Removed 4 redundant SessionStart hooks (already called inside session-start.sh), merged 4 SessionEnd thin wrappers into session-end-maintenance.sh, moved maturity scan to session end.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **cmd/ao test coverage to 60.2%** — 5 rounds of targeted tests covering badge, store, fire, batch_promote, rpi_phased, context, and 30+ helper functions. Coverage floor goal now passing.
- **Vibe-kit selection manifest** for plugin packaging
- **CI badges and Codecov integration** with complexity and race detection pre-push gates
- **Infrastructure scripts** — `--per-file`, `--track-delta`, and cycle estimator for evolve tooling

### Changed

- **Repo root decluttered** — Moved CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY into `docs/`. All cross-references updated across 15 files.
- **Evolve cycles 5–116 landed** — Zero functions at complexity >= 8, coverage 95%+ across all internal packages, sentinel errors and benchmarks in all 15 packages, Go 1.23 idiom modernization (slices, cmp.Or, range-over-int, CutPrefix), exhaustive switches, errorlint/gocritic compliance.
- **CI hardened** — Embedded sync path fix, security scan false positive exclusions (`_test.go`, `.claude/`), security toolchain gate made non-blocking, local CI gate secret scan and tool requirements fixed.
- **Git author corrected** — Rewrote 157 commits from stale `Test User` to correct identity.

### Fixed

- **CI pipeline** — Embedded hooks sync path after `cd cli`, security scan `secretFile` false positive, toolchain gate missing optional tools
- **Push-gate race** — `$ROOT` assignment moved before race gate check
- **Race test mitigations** — Added `-count=1`, timeout, and duration monitoring
- **Local CI gate** — Excluded test files from secret scan, dropped `--require-tools` for missing hadolint
- **Golangci-lint debt** — Dead code, errcheck, gosimple, test factory cleanups
- **4 failing goals** — Telemetry ref, doc link validator, GOALS check path, evolve measurement

## [2.14.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Two-tier execution mode taxonomy** — Skills now follow an explicit orchestrator/worker fork classification. Orchestrators (evolve, rpi, crank, vibe, post-mortem) stay in the main session for visibility. Worker spawners (council, codex-team) fork into subagents. Documented in `SKILL-TIERS.md` and `skill-structure.md`.
- **116 evolve cycles** — Automated improvement loop ran 116 cycles, delivering: test coverage from ~70% to 95%+ across all packages, zero functions at complexity >= 8, sentinel errors in all packages, benchmarks in all 15 packages, Go 1.23 idiom modernization (slices, cmp.Or, range-over-int, CutPrefix), exhaustive switch statements, and consistent errorlint/gocritic compliance.
- **RPI control plane hardening** — Integration tests for RPI orchestrator, supervisor determinism, recovery edges, and detached-HEAD healing. Branch pruning controls to prevent worktree sprawl.
- **Pre-commit/pre-push gates** — Go build gate on commit, full validation gate (build + vet + test + hooks + skill counts) on push.
- **Go modern idiom catalog** — Standards updated with JetBrains-sourced Go 1.21–1.23 idiom catalog covering slices, maps, cmp, slog, and range patterns.
- **Validation scripts** — Added `check-evolve-cycle-logging.sh`, `check-go-absolute-complexity.sh`, `check-go-per-package-coverage.sh` for CI and evolve goal measurement.

### Changed

- **Fork classification corrected** — Removed `context: fork` from evolve, crank, and post-mortem (orchestrators that were invisibly forking). Added `context: fork` to codex-team (worker spawner that should fork). Council retains `context: fork` (correct).
- **Go modernized to 1.23 idioms** — Replaced `sort.Slice` with `slices.SortFunc`, `interface{}` with `any` (280+ occurrences), `strings.HasPrefix`+slice with `strings.CutPrefix`, added `cmp.Or` for defaults, range-over-int for counting loops.
- **Top 5 cmd/ao complexity reduced 82.7%** — Extracted helpers from the 5 highest-complexity functions: `runRPILoop` (37→9), `spawnRuntimePhaseWithStream` (32→3), `resolveLoopSupervisorConfig` (32→5), `executeRPICleanup` (28→4), `runBatchFeedback` (27→6). Aggregate 156→27.
- **Goals pruned 83 to 25** — Removed stale/redundant goals, added trust-and-prove track specs.
- **RPI loop supervisor hardened** — Failure policy, cycle retries, lease-based locking, stale worktree auto-cleanup, landing policy controls.

### Fixed

- **Evolve visibility** — `/evolve` no longer forks into an invisible subagent. Operator can now see cycle-by-cycle progress, fitness measurements, and intervene.
- **Detached-branch sprawl** — RPI loop now prunes branches and avoids detached-HEAD sprawl.
- **Per-package coverage** — Fixed name extraction and kill-switch sentinel error in coverage tooling.
- **Hook reliability** — Rotated chain.jsonl, cached file counts, removed redundant hooks.

## [2.13.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Claude Code best-practices alignment** — All 53 skills now use appropriate frontmatter: `disable-model-invocation` on dangerous skills, `user-invocable: false` on background skills, `allowed-tools` on read-only skills, `model: haiku` on lightweight skills, `context: fork` on heavy skills.
- **Plugin agents directory** — New `agents/code-reviewer.md` and `agents/researcher.md` distributed via the plugin for use as Claude Code subagents.
- **Hook event coverage** — Adopted Claude Code v2.1.47–v2.1.50 hook events; extracted 10 inline hook commands into named scripts under `hooks/`.
- **MemRL packet v1 lifecycle** — Added packet lifecycle contract with canonical identity joins for the memory reinforcement learning subsystem.
- **Safe worktree GC** — Added worktree garbage collection with serialized session-end maintenance to prevent concurrent cleanup races.
- **Proactive improvement agenda** — `/retro` and `/post-mortem` now require a structured improvement proposal with every retrospective.

### Changed

- **Local CI release gate parallelized** — Restructured `ci-local-release.sh` into phased parallel execution with new `--fast` flag (~30s vs ~100s+).
- **Skill structure reference v2.0.0** — Updated `skill-structure.md` to document all 10 Claude Code frontmatter fields with upstream source attribution.
- **Evolve skill split** — Reduced `skills/evolve/SKILL.md` from 778 to 493 lines by extracting cycle-history reference.
- **Hook CPU guardrails** — Bounded batch feedback loops and hardened hook robustness for faster local CI.
- **Auto-promotion hardening** — Hardened promotion pipeline with legacy capture migration support.
- **Cached-memory flow** — Aligned learn-ingest and staged promotion flows for knowledge flywheel consistency.

### Fixed

- **CI false positives** — Excluded `.tmp/` from secret and dangerous-pattern scans; fixed dangerous-pattern scan for CI test fixtures.
- **CLI reference generation** — Made UTC-stable to prevent timezone-dependent diffs.
- **Hook tech debt** — Addressed post-mortem findings on hook reliability and install paths.
- **RPI stale cleanup** — Hardened stale-run detection and startup state persistence.
- **Reverse-engineer docs** — Improved detection and validation for reverse-engineer-rpi workflows.

### Removed

- **Stale docs/anthropic-skills-guide.md** — Deleted local copy of upstream Claude Code docs that caused false pre-mortem failures. Replaced with link to `code.claude.com/docs/en/skills`.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Hotfix release** — Bump plugin manifest and marketplace versions to trigger binary rebuild and marketplace update.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Context-guard workflow protections** — Added assignment mapping plus proactive handoff and one-shot recovery markers to reduce stale-session drift and improve recovery behavior.
- **Claude team context enhancements** — Expanded `ao` support for Claude team context handling and related docs.
- **Security-suite primitives** — Added `/security-suite` for composable binary assurance (static/dynamic collection, contract capture, baseline drift, and policy gating).
- **RPI stale-run cleanup tooling** — Added stale run detection, `ao rpi cleanup`, and configurable worktree cleanup mode.
- **Plan skill symbol-level specs** — `/plan` now generates file inventory tables, exact function references with line numbers, inline code blocks, named test functions, and verification procedures for implementation-ready specs.
- **Inline quick-start examples** — Added working examples to `/evolve` and `/vibe` skill docs for faster onboarding.
- **Destructive path tests** — Added test coverage for worktree path validation edge cases.
- **Skill lint references dir** — Added `references/` directory for skill lint tooling.

### Changed

- **Install guidance priorities** — Claude marketplace/plugin install is now the first install path, with `npx skills` positioned as the cross-agent path for Codex/Cursor/OpenCode.
- **Homebrew update consistency** — Standardized upgrade messaging to `brew update && brew upgrade agentops` across docs/release notes and improved installer fallback messaging.
- **Repository hygiene** — `.agents/` artifacts are now fully ignored to keep generated local state out of tracked source history.
- **Release gating model** — Release validation moved to local CI (`scripts/ci-local-release.sh`) while GitHub Actions release workflow is now publisher-only.
- **Validate script compatibility** — Updated validate scripts for tier renames and ruff output format changes.
- **npx skills troubleshooting** — Added troubleshooting guidance for `npx skills update` issues.

### Fixed

- **Claude plugin marketplace compatibility** — Removed unsupported `"$schema"` key in plugin manifest so `claude plugin install agentops@agentops-marketplace` succeeds.
- **RPI phased reliability** — Hardened stream startup/fallback behavior and resolved related validation regressions.
- **Hook/runtime regressions** — Fixed hook-coverage compile regressions and restored install symbols used by `ao init`/`ao doctor`.
- **CLI quality debt** — Addressed lint/staticcheck regressions and reduced `runInit` complexity below CI threshold.
- **RPI cleanup reliability** — Persisted terminal metadata and validated stale-run worktree paths before cleanup.
- **Worktree path validation** — Tightened path validation to prevent destructive operations on invalid worktree paths.

## [2.12.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Claude plugin marketplace install compatibility** — Removed unsupported `"$schema"` key from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, which caused `claude plugin install agentops@agentops-marketplace` to fail manifest validation.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **RPI phased engine enhancements** — Added executor backend routing (swarm-first), deterministic queue semantics, run-scoped artifact contracts, step aliases, and stricter lifecycle/failure propagation.
- **MemRL policy foundation** — Added deterministic MemRL policy package and AO export contract.
- **Validation and security gates** — Added changed-scope Go race pre-push gating, markdownlint baseline CI gating, and blocking gitleaks security gate integration.
- **Flywheel/knowledge coverage** — Added ao-free fallbacks, cross-repo knowledge wiring, and stronger flywheel consistency diagnostics.

### Changed

- **RPI model alignment** — Standardized docs and tests around the 3-phase RPI model.
- **Hook install defaults** — `ao init --hooks` now defaults to full 8-event coverage, with explicit minimal mode available.
- **Docs and routing guidance** — Expanded README/skill routing guidance and reverse-engineering documentation.

### Fixed

- **Hook runtime/install regression** — `chain-parser.sh` is now shipped with installs, and hook sourcing degrades gracefully if helper files are missing.
- **RPI reliability** — Fixed dry-run preflight behavior, stream watchdog timeout handling, and pre-mortem default mode fallback.
- **Knowledge/search correctness** — Research now searches all knowledge locations; retrieval effectiveness calculation was corrected.
- **Security/CI stability** — Fixed gitleaks install path, resolved semgrep false positives, and re-enabled the blocking security gate.
- **CLI correctness** — Fixed `ao doctor` plugin path checks, pool promotion filename-collision handling, and schema test repo-pollution behavior.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Embedded hooks** — ao binary now ships hooks via Go `embed`, eliminating external hook file dependencies at runtime.
- **reverse-engineer-rpi enhancements** — Comparison report generation, binary mode self-test assertions, binary CLI surface spec with registry enrichment, and `--help` capture for Go CLI detection.
- **Codex/PR/OSS skills** — New `pr-research`, `pr-plan`, `pr-implement`, `pr-validate`, `pr-prep`, `pr-retro`, `oss-docs`, and `openai-docs` skills.
- **`/security` skill** — Continuous security scanning and release gating with `security-gate.sh`.

### Fixed

- **`ao pool auto-promote`** — Defaults threshold corrected to 7 days.
- **`ao pool ingest`** — Processed files now moved to `processed/` directory.
- **`ao doctor` search index** — Fixed wrong path and remediation command for `checkSearchIndex`.
- **`doctor_test.go`** — Search index test now uses `IndexDir`/`IndexFileName` constants instead of hardcoded paths.
- **oss-docs** — Fixed broken links in reference template.
- **Markdown standards** — Fixed example links that broke the doc-release link checker.

## [2.10.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **`--upstream-ref` flag** (reverse-engineer-rpi) — Pin repo clones to a specific commit, tag, or branch. Emits `clone-metadata.json` with resolved SHA for reproducibility.
- **Python CLI detection** (reverse-engineer-rpi) — Detects Click, argparse, and Typer CLIs via `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621 + Poetry) and `setup.cfg` entry_points.
- **Go CLI detection** (reverse-engineer-rpi) — Detects Go CLIs via `go.mod` + `cmd/*/main.go` pattern with Cobra and stdlib flag framework detection.
- **Self-test improvements** (reverse-engineer-rpi) — Negative test for invalid mode, upstream-ref pinning test with `file://` protocol, multi-language graceful degradation test.

### Changed

- **Tuning defaults** — Sonnet default for judges and workers, opus reserved for leads. `--quick` default for all gates at low+medium complexity. Cap judges at 2, consolidate product to 1 judge, quick pre-mortem.
- **`ao rpi phased`** — Consolidated from 6 phases to 3.
- **Issue templates** — Professionalized docs, added glossary updates, modernized templates.
- **reverse-engineer-rpi SKILL.md** — Documented `--upstream-ref`, `clone-metadata.json` output, Python/Go CLI detection, pinned clone example.

### Fixed

- **`ao rpi phased` spawning** — Reliability fix for agent sessions.
- **Lint failures** — Resolved 3 lint failures, added lint hook and config tests.
- **Tuning validation** — Added 33-assertion tuning defaults validation suite.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Backend reference docs** — Concrete tool call examples for each spawn backend: Claude native teams (`TeamCreate` + `SendMessage`), Codex sub-agents/CLI, background tasks fallback, and inline degraded mode. Shared at `skills/shared/references/backend-*.md`.

### Changed

- **README** — Reframed Flow as orchestration + single-piece flow, Feedback and Learning with Phoenix Project vibes, sell `ao rpi` phased as the killer feature. Streamlined install, condensed intro. Aligned tagline across all manifests.
- **Quickstart** — Added rpi/product/goals/evolve progression to Step 7.
- **Skills rewrite** — Runtime-agnostic capability contracts replace hardcoded tool names. Council, swarm, and research skills now load backend-specific references after detection.
- **Goals skill** — New `ao goals` CLI commands wired into the skills layer.

### Fixed

- **Cross-skill reference linting** — `lint-skills.sh` now resolves `skills/*/references/` paths from repo root instead of failing on cross-skill references.
- **Swarm validation** — Updated `validate.sh` to check for backend reference documentation pattern instead of requiring inline `TeamCreate`/`spawn_agent` strings.
- **Council context explosion** — Banned background tasks, patched v2.10.0 release notes.
- **Cache eviction** — Three-wave implementation: passive tracking with decay write-back, composite eviction criteria with cache health goals, SessionEnd hook wiring.
- **Stars badge** — Fixed shields.io social variant rendering.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **`/brainstorm` skill** — Structured idea exploration before `/plan`. Four phases: assess clarity, understand the idea, explore approaches, capture design decisions. Output goes to `.agents/brainstorm/`.
- **`/heal-skill` skill** — Automated skill hygiene checker. Detects missing frontmatter, name mismatches, unlinked references, dead references, and empty directories. Supports `--check` (report) and `--fix` (auto-repair) modes.
- **`/converter` skill** — Cross-platform skill converter pipeline (parse → convert → write). Codex target produces `SKILL.md` + `prompt.md` with 1024-char description truncation. Cursor target produces `.mdc` rule files with 100KB budget-fitting and optional `mcp.json` for MCP-referencing skills. Test target dumps raw SkillBundle for inspection.
- **`/readme` skill** — Gold-standard README generation with council validation.
- **Named council perspectives** — `--perspectives="a,b,c"` for free-form judge viewpoints, `--perspectives-file=<path>` for YAML-defined perspectives with focus descriptions. Perspectives override presets when both are specified.
- **`doc-review` council preset** — Four perspectives for documentation quality review: clarity-editor, accuracy-verifier, completeness-auditor, audience-advocate.
- **PRODUCT.md** — Product definition document with mission, personas, value props, and roadmap.
- **`reverse-engineer-rpi` skill** — Reverse-engineer a product into feature inventory, registry, code map, and specs. Supports repo mode, binary mode (with `--authorized` guard), and security audit mode.

### Changed

- **README rewritten** — Lead with the problem ("agents forget between sessions"), acknowledge prior art, add trust block near install, collapse depth with details blocks. Terminal transcripts instead of assertions.
- **Skill count** — 39 → 42 skills (32 user-facing, 10 internal). All counts synchronized across 8 files with CI validation.
- **Council SKILL.md trimmed** — Consolidated named perspectives section to stay under 550-line limit. Preset details moved to `references/personas.md`.
- **Council context budget** — Judges write full analysis to output files, send only `{verdict, confidence, file}` via message. Consolidation runs inline as team lead (no chairman agent). Debate R2 sends verdict summaries instead of full JSON.
- **Background task ban** — `Task(run_in_background=true)` replaced with foreground `Task()` across council, swarm, research, shared, SKILL-TIERS, and validation-contract. Causes Claude instability. `Bash(run_in_background=true)` for Codex CLI processes unchanged.
- **`reverse-engineer-rpi`** — Increased 1:1 fidelity for CLI and artifact surface matching.

### Fixed

- **Skill count validator** — Excluded `.tmp` directories from `find` count to prevent test artifacts inflating totals.
- **`brainstorm` trigger collision** — Added `brainstorm` overlap between `/brainstorm` and `/council brainstorm` to alias collision allowlist.
- **`readme` skill missing from SKILL-TIERS.md** — Added to user-facing skills table.
- **Validation test failures** — Fixed heal-skill example text triggering false-positive dead-ref detection, council line count exceeding limit.
- **Council context explosion** — Spawning 7+ judges flooded lead's context window via SendMessage. Judges now send minimal 4-line completion signals.

## [2.9.3] - 2026-02-16

### Changed

- **Quickstart skill menu** — Added 10 missing skills (`/release`, `/rpi`, `/evolve`, `/status`, `/recover`, `/product`, `/codex-team`) to the onboarding orientation. New users now see all 26 user-facing skills.
- **Using-agentops skill catalog** — Updated Available Skills table from 17 to all 26 user-facing skills with natural language triggers for each.
- **Install instructions** — All `brew install` commands now include the Homebrew tap prefix (`boshu2/agentops`) so new users don't hit "formula not found". Updated `ao hooks install` references to `ao init --hooks`.
- **Troubleshooting** — Fixed incorrect hooks.json path (was `.claude-plugin/hooks.json`, now `hooks/hooks.json`).

### Fixed

- **Release pipeline empty body** — GoReleaser created an "untagged" release with empty body when a draft release already existed for the tag. Workflow now deletes any existing release before GoReleaser runs.
- **Release skill skip draft creation** — `/release` no longer creates a draft GitHub Release via `gh release create`. GoReleaser handles release creation in CI; local drafts conflict with it.
- **Goal count test** — `validate-goal-count.sh` no longer crashes when README doesn't contain a hardcoded goal count.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **`ao init` consolidated entry point** — Single command to set up a repo for AgentOps: creates all `.agents/` directories, manages `.gitignore` (with `--stealth` for `.git/info/exclude`), and optionally registers hooks via `--hooks`. Idempotent, dry-run capable. 12 unit tests.
- **Auto-gitignore `.agents/`** — Session-start hook automatically adds `.agents/` to `.gitignore` and creates a nested deny-all `.agents/.gitignore`. Dangerous-git-guard warns when `.agents/` files are staged.

### Fixed

- **Symlink file-read in standards-injector** — Rejects symlinked standards files and verifies resolved path stays within `skills/standards/references/`.
- **Non-git source directory for hook install** — `ao hooks install --full` now errors (not warns) when source directory is not a git root.
- **Command injection in task-validation-gate** — Blocked newlines and quotes in restricted command execution.
- **Dir list sync** — `ao init` and `session-start.sh` now create identical directory sets (added `.agents/plans/` and `.agents/rpi/`).
- **Version badge** — README badge updated from 2.9.0 to 2.9.2.
- **Release notes quality** — `extract-release-notes.sh` now requires a CHANGELOG entry (no more commit-dump fallback) and supports curated highlights from `.agents/releases/`.
- **Release pipeline crash in CI** — `extract-release-notes.sh` failed with `set -euo pipefail` when `.agents/releases/` directory didn't exist (gitignored). Added `|| true` to the `find` pipeline.

### Changed

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Added `ao init` to contributor setup instructions.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Knowledge cache core** — `ao index` for citation-backed search index, `ao metrics cite-report` for citation health, `ao maturity --expire` for stale artifact cleanup. 530+ new test assertions.
- **`/update` skill** — One-command skill reinstall (`npx skills@latest add boshu2/agentops --all -g`).
- **`/evolve` enhancements** — Added references for artifacts and examples.

### Changed

- **README** — Added town planning example to See It Work section.
- **License** — Corrected from MIT to Apache-2.0 in goreleaser and brew formula.
- **Goals fitness** — Trimmed skills, hardened tests, improved docs across 6 epics.
- **.agents/ directory** — Now gitignored; removed tracked session data and PII.

### Fixed

- **Hook security hardening** — Removed `npx` and `bash` from task-validation-gate allowlist (closed RCE vector), sourced hook-helpers.sh from plugin install dir instead of repo root (closed confused-deputy code execution), removed kill switch self-advertising from push-gate and pre-mortem-gate stderr, added `git restore` to dangerous-git-guard blocklist.
- **Code injection via crafted filenames** — Hardened prescan.sh filename handling.
- **Stale counts** — Corrected GOALS.yaml and README skill/goal counts.
- **INDEX.md exclusion** — Excluded from learning-format-compliance goal check.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **`/recover` skill** — Post-compaction context recovery. Detects in-progress RPI and evolve sessions, loads knowledge, shows recent work and pending tasks. Behavioral validation with 6 checks.
- **`ao vibe-check` CLI command** — Full vibecheck Go package: timeline parser, 5 health metrics, 4 detectors (stagnation, thrashing, drift, regression), orchestrator, and Cobra command with `--json`/`--markdown`/`--since`/`--full` flags. 60+ tests. Session-end hook auto-captures vibe snapshots.
- **`ao rpi status` CLI command** — Dashboard showing RPI phase progress, current state, and recent activity.
- **`scripts/sync-skill-counts.sh`** — Single-source-of-truth skill count updater. Derives counts from disk + SKILL-TIERS.md, patches all 11 hardcoded locations across 6 files. Supports `--check` mode for CI dry-run. Integrated into doc-release-gate CI.
- **`next-work.jsonl` schema v1.2** — Added `target_repo` field for cross-rig work harvesting.
- **Git worktree isolation for `ao rpi phased`** — Each phase runs in its own worktree, preventing cross-phase contamination.
- **Test infrastructure expansion** — CLI smoke tests, skill invocation tests, hook-chain tests, structural assertions, CLI coverage to 12 commands, shared test colors, binary caching, dynamic counts, integration test wiring.
- **GOALS.yaml restructure** — Goal-count goal, release size cap, goal-count validator script.

### Changed

- **v3 roadmap** — Retro trajectory analysis documented future direction based on evolve session learnings.
- **README** — Added worktree isolation to Phased RPI section.

### Fixed

- **Crank context explosion** — Replaced per-wave vibe gate (9,407 lines loaded per wave) with lightweight inline acceptance check. Worker results now write to disk instead of flooding orchestrator context.
- **Skill count drift** — Updated all 11 locations for /recover addition (35 total: 25 user-facing, 10 internal). Created sync script to prevent recurrence.
- **Shellcheck compliance** — Added directive to colors.sh (SC2148).
- **CHANGELOG goal count** — Fixed active drift (42→44).
- **Worktree merge retry** — Pre-merge dirty check now retries for parallel worktree merges.
- **CLAUDECODE env var** — Stripped from `ao rpi phased` child sessions to prevent interference.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **`ao rpi phased` command** — Solves the context window problem with `/rpi`. Currently `/rpi` runs all 6 phases in one session — the context fills up and you rely on compaction being lossless (it mostly is, since real state lives in plans and beads issues, but you're hoping). `ao rpi phased` runs each phase in its own fresh Claude session. The Go CLI carries state between phases via filesystem artifacts (goal, verdicts, phase summaries), so each session starts clean with exactly the context it needs. Three modes: hands-free (`ao rpi phased "goal"`), interactive with human gates at research/plan (`--interactive`), or resume from any phase (`--from=crank`). Also supports `--fast-path` for small epics, `--max-retries` for retry loops with structured findings. Per-phase token budgets prevent compaction. Runnable by a human from the terminal or by an agent — it's a CLI command, not a skill. 33 unit tests.
- **Wire 10 ao CLI commands into skills/hooks** — `ao maturity --scan` on SessionStart; `ao session-outcome`, `ao feedback-loop`, `ao task-sync`, `ao batch-feedback` on SessionEnd; `ao badge` and `ao task-status` in `/status`; `ao maturity --scan`, `ao promote-anti-patterns`, `ao badge` in `/flywheel`; `ao feedback-loop`, `ao session-outcome`, `ao temper validate` in `/post-mortem`; `ao task-feedback` in `/retro`. Every ao command now has an automated caller — only `ao rpi phased`, `ao search`, and `ao demo` remain human-typed.
- **3-layer compaction prevention tests** — Layer 1: `test-token-budgets.sh` statically checks per-skill and SessionStart token budgets without running the CLI. Layer 2: `test-no-compaction.sh` runs 3 scenarios asserting no `compact_boundary` events and <60% context utilization. Layer 3: reusable `assert_context_under_60pct` helper parsing `stream-json` peak token usage.
- **.agents/ directory standardization** — RPI phase summaries now use dated filenames to prevent silent overwrites between cycles. `.agents/README.md` rewritten documenting all 25+ directories with purpose, writers, and retention policies. New `scripts/prune-agents.sh` enforces per-directory retention (dry-run default). SessionStart hook warns when `.agents/` exceeds 500 files.

### Changed

- **README CLI section** — Reframed: the ao CLI is plumbing invoked by skills and hooks, not a human interface. Added automation map showing which skills/hooks call which commands. Added CASS search example to "See It Work" section.
- **CLAUDE.md** — Synced stale metadata, added 9 development pitfalls (verified mechanically, go test validation, TaskCreate ordering, lead-only commits, grep call sites, no hardcoded counts, full corpus validation, tight regex, file disjointness).
- **Crank SKILL.md slimmed** — Context-discipline goal added to GOALS.yaml.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-02-14

### Changed

- **GOALS.yaml expanded to 20 goals** — Added `behavioral-skill-contracts`, `hook-tests-pass`, and `incident-runbook-exists`.

### Changed

- **`--test-first` flag passthrough** — `/rpi --test-first` and `/evolve --test-first` now pass the flag through to `/crank` for spec-first TDD across the full lifecycle.
- **Evolve full-fitness regression gate** — Step 5 re-checks ALL goals (not just target) after each cycle. Multi-commit revert using cycle start SHA. Continuous fitness values in snapshots.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **`/evolve` skill** — Autonomous fitness-scored improvement loop. Measures `GOALS.yaml` fitness, picks the worst-scoring goal, runs `/rpi` to fix it, re-measures. Compounds via the knowledge flywheel — each cycle loads learnings from all prior cycles. Includes kill switches (`~/.config/evolve/KILL`, `.agents/evolve/STOP`), `--dry-run` mode, and harvested-work queue from `next-work.jsonl`.
- **`/product` skill** — Interactive interview that generates a filled-in `PRODUCT.md` covering mission, personas, value propositions, and competitive landscape. New `product` and `developer-experience` council presets.

- **Hook error recovery and auto-handoff** — All hook failure paths now include error recovery suggestions and auto-handoff context. Shared `lib/hook-helpers.sh` with `write_failure()`, `schema_version`, and ISO timestamps. Dual-output pattern applied to all failure paths.
- **Spec-completeness judge** — New council judge validates specs for completeness with cross-cutting constraint injection. Domain-neutrality check included.
- **`/plan` SDD boundaries** — Solution Design Document patterns with conformance checks, new `sdd-patterns.md` reference.
- **`/post-mortem` checkpoint policy** — Preflight validator with metadata verification reference.
- **GOALS.yaml fitness suite** — 11 goals for automated repo health measurement. Release pre-flight manifest check.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Knowledge flywheel wiring across RPI skills** — `/plan`, `/pre-mortem`, and `/vibe` now search `ao` for prior learnings before council dispatch (`ao search` with guard + fallback). `/plan` and `/pre-mortem` record ratchet progress after completion. Session-start hook runs `ao extract` to close the forge-extract loop.
- **Retro remediation hardening sweep** — JSON Schema validation for plugin and hooks manifests (`schemas/`), Dependabot config for Go + GitHub Actions, release workflow stub, hook preflight validator, expanded hook integration tests (170+ lines), doc-release validation script.
- **`ao forge markdown` subcommand** — Forge now supports mining `.md` files in addition to `.jsonl` transcripts (256+ LOC in `forge.go`).
- **Task-validation-gate command allowlist** — Replaced `eval()` shell injection vector with allowlist-based execution; only `go`, `pytest`, `npm`, `npx`, `make`, `bash` permitted.
- **Self-perpetuating knowledge flywheel** — Post-mortem now synthesizes process improvement proposals from retro learnings (Step 5.5), always suggests a ready-to-copy next `/rpi` command (Step 7), and harvests `process-improvement` items alongside tech-debt (Step 8). `/rpi` Step Final always shows the flywheel section with the next suggested cycle. Every run ends by pointing at the next one — the system grows knowledge with each use.

### Changed

- **README onboarding and engagement** — Expanded install flow with plugin adoption path, swarm/Ralph loop backend support clarification, engagement funnel improvements, issue routing via CONTRIBUTING.md and GitHub issue templates.
- **Smoke and e2e test improvements** — Timeout shims, environment variable documentation in `docs/reference.md`, CI workflow matrix improvements.

### Fixed

- **8 vibe WARN findings from retro remediation** — CI validate workflow permissions, schema `additionalProperties` consistency, hook preflight script exit codes, smoke test portability, tasks-sync error handling.
- **Command injection in task-validation-gate.sh** — Fixed `eval()` on untrusted metadata (shipped alongside `ao forge markdown` in `acc49f8`).

### Removed

- **Multi-agent preflight script** — Removed `scripts/multi-agent-preflight.sh` (268 lines) and all distributed-mode references to it from crank, implement, and swarm skills. Superseded by native team pre-flight in each skill.
- **Low-value vibe fixes reverted** — Removed env var docs and timeout shim additions that added complexity without proportional value.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Runtime-native spawn backend contract** — `skills/shared/SKILL.md` now defines backend selection order for orchestration skills: `spawn_agent` → `TeamCreate` → `Task(run_in_background=true)`, plus operation mapping for spawn/wait/retry/cleanup.
- **Codex sub-agent execution reference flows** — `skills/swarm/references/local-mode.md` and `skills/council/references/cli-spawning.md` now include concrete `spawn_agent`, `wait`, `send_input`, and `close_agent` patterns.

### Changed

- **Swarm/Council/Crank/Codex-Team runtime universality** — `skills/swarm/SKILL.md`, `skills/council/SKILL.md`, `skills/crank/SKILL.md`, and `skills/codex-team/SKILL.md` now document runtime-native orchestration (Codex sub-agents or Claude teams with fallback).
- **Council validator generalized** — `skills/council/scripts/validate-council.sh` now validates judge counts without Claude-specific assumptions.
- **Core docs updated for Codex sub-agents** — `README.md`, `docs/reference.md`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` now describe runtime-native backend selection and coordination behavior.
- **Swarm validator updated** — `skills/swarm/scripts/validate.sh` now validates runtime backend selection and cleanup lifecycle documentation.

### Fixed

- **Release skill doc-link integrity** — Fixed `skills/release/SKILL.md` changelog link template to satisfy doc link validation.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **`ao pool ingest`** — New command to ingest `.agents/knowledge/pending/*.md` learnings into `.agents/pool/` candidates with stable IDs and preserved timestamps.
- **`ao flywheel close-loop`** — New orchestration command chaining: `pool ingest → auto-promote (promote) → promote-anti-patterns → store --categorize`.
- **Codex session-end equivalent** — `~/.codex/agentops/.codex/agentops-codex session-end` for manual close-loop on Codex (since Codex has no native Stop hook).

### Changed

- **`ao pool auto-promote`** — Added `--promote` mode to stage and promote eligible silver/gold candidates into `.agents/learnings/` / `.agents/patterns/`.
- **`ao store` indexing** — Added `--categorize` to capture `category` and `tags` metadata in index entries.
- **Codex bootstrap/install docs** — Updated `.codex/agentops-bootstrap.md` and `.codex/INSTALL.md` with session-end workflow and usage.

### Fixed

- **Stop hook close-loop wiring** — `hooks/hooks.json` Stop hook now executes flywheel close-loop and logs failures to `.agents/ao/hook-errors.log`.
- **Codex compatibility fallback** — `agentops-codex session-end` falls back to repo-local `go run ./cmd/ao` when system `ao` is missing/outdated.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-10

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **`/rpi` lifecycle skill** — One command, full lifecycle. Research → Plan → Pre-mortem → Crank → Vibe → Post-mortem. Give it a goal, get production code with multi-model validation at every gate. Autonomous by default — zero human prompts. Failed validations trigger retry loops with failure context, not escalation.
- **`--auto` is now the default for `/rpi`** — Just type `/rpi "goal"` and walk away. Use `--interactive` if you want human gates at research and plan phases. `--auto` flag kept for backwards compatibility.
- **`--auto` mode for `/research` and `/plan`** — Sub-skills now accept `--auto` to skip human approval gates. Enables fully autonomous `/rpi` pipeline.

### Changed

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **`ao hooks install` generates invalid format for Claude Code 2.1+** — Hook entries used old `{matcher, command: []}` format; now generates correct `{hooks: [{type: "command", command: "..."}]}` matcher format. Detection and merge logic handles both old and new formats for backwards compatibility.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Flywheel automation CLI** (ag-m0r) — 4 new `ao` commands that replace fragile bash parsing in hooks with structured JSON output

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **`bin/ralph`** — Full RPI loop script (Goal → Plan → Pre-mortem → Crank → Vibe → Post-mortem → PR). Each phase gets a fresh Claude context window (Ralph Wiggum pattern). Features: `--dry-run`, `--skip-pre-mortem`, `--branch`, `--spec` for acceptance criteria, `--resume` for checkpoint/resume, `--max-budget` and `--phase-timeout` for gutter detection.
- **`/codex-team` skill** — Spawn parallel Codex execution agents from Claude. Claude orchestrates task decomposition, Codex agents execute independently via `codex exec --full-auto`. Includes pre-flight checks, canonical command form, prompt guidelines, and fallback to `/swarm`.
- **`/codex-team` file-conflict prevention** — Team lead analyzes file targets before spawning: same-file tasks merge into one agent, dependent tasks sequence into waves with context injection, different-file tasks run in parallel. The orchestrator IS the lock manager.
- **`/release` skill** — General-purpose release workflow: pre-flight validation (`--check` mode), changelog generation from git history, semver suggestion from commit classification, version bump detection across ecosystems (package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go files), release commit, annotated tag, and optional draft GitHub Release. Boundary at the git tag — everything local and reversible.

### Crank All Epics (ag-kmk, ag-e0g, ag-ow7)

Autonomous execution of 19 issues across 3 epics in 3 waves (18 parallel workers, ~16 minutes, 100% success rate, zero retries).

#### Skills Hardening (ag-kmk + ag-e0g)

- **Structured SendMessage envelope** — JSON envelope schema for machine-parseable team communication (completion, blocked, retry, progress, verdict types)
- **Conflict resolution algorithm** — Severity escalation, deduplication, quorum rules, verdict computation, contradiction handling (`.agents/specs/conflict-resolution-algorithm.md`)
- **Pre-flight checks** — Added to vibe, post-mortem, and crank: verify git repo, files exist, epic has children before spawning agents
- **Native-teams fallback bundle** — Per-capability degradation table in `skills/shared/SKILL.md`; graceful fallback when specific team features unavailable
- **Race-free swarm claiming** — Mayor assigns tasks before spawning; workers only transition status (no concurrent claim races)
- **Anti-anchoring debate protocol** — R2 judges restate their R1 position before reading others' verdicts; weak flip detection in consolidation
- **Lead-only commit policy** — Workers write files, never `git commit`; team lead validates and commits per wave
- **Validation contract updated** — Default validation checks worker-reported artifacts, not commit history
- **Reaper cleanup pattern** — Graceful team shutdown sequence (shutdown_request → wait → TeamDelete) with configurable timeouts
- **Agent timeout and partial completion** — Worker timeout (180s), quorum handling for partial council results

#### ao CLI Quality (ag-ow7)

- **Shell completion** — `ao completion bash|zsh|fish` for tab-complete support
- **`ao forge batch`** — Scan and process pending transcripts in bulk with deduplication
- **`ao pool batch-promote`** — Bulk promote pending candidates meeting criteria (age >24h, cited, not duplicate)
- **File splits** — `ratchet.go` (1001→11 files), `metrics.go` (930→5 files), `inject.go` (891→5 files) for maintainability

### Fixed

- **Batch dedup false positives** — Replaced naive 80-char and 200-char prefix truncation in `normalizeForDedup` and `normalizeContent` with SHA256 content hashing. Distinct learnings with similar openings are no longer silently deduplicated.
- **Batch command test coverage** — Added `batch_forge_test.go` and `batch_promote_test.go` covering dedup logic, promotion criteria, citation counting, transcript discovery, and content loading.
- **Council findings** — Vibe always uses `--deep` (3 judges), debate enabled in post-mortem, auto-escalation when preset specifies more perspectives than judge count.

### Changed

- **Council redesign** — Independent judges by default (no perspective labels); diversity from sampling, not personality. Specialized presets (`code-review`, `plan-review`, `retrospective`) used by wrapper skills (`/vibe`, `/pre-mortem`, `/post-mortem`).
- **Codex model updated to `gpt-5.3-codex`** — All references across council, shared, and SKILL-TIERS updated from `gpt-5.3` to `gpt-5.3-codex` (canonical Codex model name).
- **README rewrite** — 479→149 lines. Leads with value prop, moved architecture and deep docs to `docs/reference.md`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-06

### Adoption Improvements

Driven by council analysis (3 judges + 6 explorers) and pre-mortem validation (2 judges, unanimous WARN → fixes applied).

#### README Overhaul

- **Tagline reframed** — "DevOps for AI agents" → "A knowledge flywheel for AI coding agents — your agent remembers across sessions." Leads with the differentiator (knowledge compounding), not the analogy
- **Tier table added** — Tier 0 (skills only) through Tier 3 (cross-vendor consensus) with graduation triggers. Uses "Tier" naming to avoid collision with existing L1-L5 learning path
- **What This Is reframed** — Flywheel narrative leads ("each session feeds the next"), ASCII diagram preserved in `<details>` block
- **Quick Start rewritten** — Self-contained with commands and context. `/quickstart` offered as optional guided tour (not primary path, due to known slash-command discoverability bug)
- **CLI Reference expanded** — MemRL retrieval, confidence decay, provenance tracking, escape velocity metrics. Leads with capabilities, not LOC count
- **"Why Agents Need DevOps" → "Why Agents Need This"** — Consistent with tagline reframe

#### Tier/Level Disambiguation

- **`docs/levels/README.md`** — Added "Tiers vs Levels" section explaining the two axes: Tiers (0-3) = what tools you install, Levels (L1-L5) = what concepts you learn. Cross-references README tier table
- **`skills/quickstart/SKILL.md`** — Added graduation hints to Step 7 based on detected CLI state (ao, beads presence). Natural language, not formal tier labels

### Native Teams Migration

**The big idea:** Council judges and swarm workers are no longer fire-and-forget background agents. They now spawn as teammates on native teams (`TeamCreate` + `SendMessage` + shared `TaskList`), enabling real-time coordination without re-spawning.

#### Council

- **Judges spawn as teammates** on a `council-YYYYMMDD-<target>` team instead of independent `Task(run_in_background=true)` calls
- **Debate R2 via SendMessage** — judges stay alive after R1 and receive other judges' full verdicts via `SendMessage`. No more re-spawning fresh R2 instances with truncated R1 summaries. Result: zero truncation loss, no spawn overhead, richer debate
- **Team cleanup** — `shutdown_request` each judge + `TeamDelete()` after consolidation
- **Communication rules** — judges message team lead only (prevents anchoring); no peer-to-peer, no TaskList access
- Updated architecture diagram with Phase 1a (Create Team) and Phase 3 (Cleanup)
- R2 output files unchanged (`.agents/council/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>-claude-{perspective}-r2.md`)

#### Swarm

- **Team-per-wave** — each wave creates a new team (`swarm-<epoch>`), preserving Ralph Wiggum fresh-context isolation
- **Workers as teammates** — workers join the wave team, claim tasks via `TaskUpdate`, and report via `SendMessage`
- **Retry via SendMessage** — failed workers receive retry instructions on their existing context (no re-spawn needed within a wave)
- **Workers access TaskList** — workers can claim and update their own tasks (previously Mayor had to reconcile everything)
- Step 5a added: team cleanup (`shutdown_request` workers + `TeamDelete`) after each wave

#### Crank

- **Diagram updated** to show swarm's team-based execution flow (`TeamCreate` per wave, `SendMessage` for reporting, `TeamDelete` after wave)
- Separation of concerns clarified: Crank = beads-aware orchestration, Swarm = team-based parallel execution

#### Shared

- **Native teams fallback** added to CLI availability/fallback table: if `TeamCreate` unavailable, fall back to `Task(run_in_background=true)` fire-and-forget
- Fallback degrades gracefully: council loses debate-via-message (reverts to R2 re-spawn with truncation), swarm loses retry-via-message (reverts to re-spawn)

### Hardening (ag-3p1)

Fixes from council validation of the native teams migration:

- **Codex model pre-flight** — council now tests model availability (not just CLI presence) before spawning Codex agents. Catches account-type restrictions (e.g. gpt-5.3-codex on ChatGPT accounts) and degrades to Claude-only
- **Debate fidelity marker** — debate reports include `**Fidelity:** full | degraded` so users know if `--debate` ran with full-context native teams or truncated fallback
- **Explicit R2 timeout** — `COUNCIL_R2_TIMEOUT` env var (default 90s) replaces vague "idle too long" with concrete timeout and fallback-to-R1 instruction
- **TeamDelete() documentation** — clarified that `TeamDelete()` targets the current session's team context; concurrent team scenarios (e.g. council inside crank) documented

### Simplification

Pre-release council validation (2 judges, unanimous WARN) identified over-engineering. Refactored before shipping:

- **Council task types 5 → 3** — merged critique→validate, analyze→research. Keeps validate, research, brainstorm
- **Removed `--perspectives-file`** — presets and `--perspectives="a,b,c"` cover all current use cases. Bring back when someone asks
- **Agent hard cap: MAX_AGENTS=12** — prevents resource bombs from `--mixed --deep --explorers=N` combinations. Pre-flight check errors if exceeded
- **`--debate` restricted to validate mode** — brainstorm and research don't produce PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts; combining with --debate now errors instead of producing "awkward outputs"
- **`--debate` documented as Ralph exception** — judges intentionally persist across R1/R2 within one atomic invocation. Bounded, documented, justified
- **Distributed mode gated as experimental** — swarm and crank distributed mode (tmux + Agent Mail) labeled experimental. Local mode (native teams) is the recommended path
- **Crank validation simplified** — collapsed triple validation (per-task + per-issue + batched) to double (trust swarm + final batched vibe). Per-issue layer was redundant

### Documentation

- Added official Skills installer instructions: `npx skills@latest add boshu2/agentops --all -g`
- Added agent-scoped install example: `npx skills@latest add boshu2/agentops -g -a codex -s '*' -y`
- Clarified that session hooks are Claude Code plugin functionality (skills remain portable)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-01

### Documentation Reality Check

Swarm documentation updated to match tested behavior:

- **TaskCreate API**: Removed invalid `blockedBy` parameter from examples. Dependencies require separate `TaskUpdate(addBlockedBy=[...])` call
- **Terminology**: "crank loops" → "atomic agents" (agents don't loop internally)
- **Monitoring**: Replaced `TaskOutput` polling with automatic `<task-notification>` pattern
- **Agent isolation**: Documented that agents cannot access TaskList/TaskUpdate - Mayor must reconcile
- **Mayor reconciliation**: Added explicit verify → update status → spawn next wave step
- **Prompts**: Simplified from complex loop instructions to atomic task format

Meta-learning: Task decomposition matters. 6 "independent" doc tasks weren't independent - they shared a file. Consolidated to 2 truly parallel tasks.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-01

### Pure Claude-Native Swarm

**The big idea:** Why depend on tmux, external scripts, or complex tooling when Claude Code has everything we need built-in?

The `/swarm` skill now uses pure Claude Code primitives:
- `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` for state management
- `Task(run_in_background=true)` for spawning background agents
- `<task-notification>` for completion callbacks

No tmux sessions. No external scripts. No beads dependency. Just Claude Code.

### Ralph Wiggum Pattern

This release documents WHY the architecture works, based on the [Ralph Wiggum Pattern](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/):

```
Ralph's bash loop:          Our swarm:
while :; do                 Mayor spawns Task → fresh context
  cat PROMPT.md | claude    Mayor spawns Task → fresh context
done                        Mayor spawns Task → fresh context
```

**Key insight:** Each `Task(run_in_background=true)` spawn creates a fresh process with clean context. Making demigods loop internally would cause context to accumulate and degrade - violating Ralph's core principle.

The loop belongs in Mayor (orchestration). Fresh context belongs in demigods (work).

### Changed

- **`/swarm` skill** - Complete rewrite:
  - Removed tmux dependency
  - Removed external script requirements
  - Pure Task tool orchestration
  - Added Ralph Wiggum pattern documentation
  - Wave execution via `blockedBy` dependencies

- **L4-parallelization docs** - Modernized:
  - Updated from `/implement-wave` to `/swarm`
  - Added Ralph Wiggum pattern explanation
  - Demo uses TaskList/TaskUpdate flow

### Technical Details

The swarm loop:

1. Mayor calls `TaskList()` to find ready tasks (pending, no blockers)
2. For each ready task, Mayor spawns: `Task(run_in_background=true, ...)`
3. Claude sends `<task-notification>` when each agent completes
4. Mayor calls `TaskUpdate(status="completed")` for finished tasks
5. This unblocks dependent tasks → next wave becomes ready
6. Repeat until all tasks complete

Each demigod has fresh context. Mayor maintains state via TaskList. Files/commits persist work across spawns.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-31

### Parallel Wave Execution

**The big idea:** When you have multiple issues that can run in parallel (no dependencies between them), why run them one at a time?

Before v1.2.0, `/crank` executed issues sequentially - finish one, start the next. Fine for small epics, but painfully slow when you have 10 independent tasks that could run simultaneously.

Now `/crank` detects **waves** - groups of issues with no blockers - and executes them in parallel using subagents. Each issue gets its own isolated agent. Results flow back to the main session.

```
Before (sequential):
  issue-1 → done → issue-2 → done → issue-3 → done
  Time: 3x

After (parallel waves):
  Wave 1: [issue-1, issue-2, issue-3] → 3 subagents in parallel → all done
  Time: 1x
```

**Why max 3 agents per wave?** Context management. Each subagent returns results that accumulate in your session. We tested higher parallelism - context explodes on complex issues. 3 is the sweet spot: meaningful speedup without blowing your context budget.

### How Waves Work

Waves emerge naturally from beads dependencies:

1. **`/plan`** creates issues with `blocks` dependencies
2. Issues with NO blockers = Wave 1 (run in parallel)
3. Issues blocked by Wave 1 = Wave 2 (run after Wave 1 completes)
4. **`bd ready`** returns the current wave - all unblocked issues
5. **`/crank`** takes the wave and dispatches up to 3 subagents

The dependency graph IS your execution plan. No separate "wave configuration" needed.

### Full Pipeline

```
/research → understand the problem
     ↓
/plan → decompose into issues with dependencies
     ↓         (waves form automatically)
/crank → execute waves in parallel
     ↓         Wave 1: [a, b, c] → 3 agents
     ↓         Wave 2: [d, e] → 2 agents
     ↓         Wave 3: [f] → 1 agent
     ↓
/post-mortem → extract learnings
```

### What's Next: Olympus

This parallel wave model is designed for **single-session work** - one Claude session spawning subagents. It's the foundation for something bigger.

**Olympus** (coming soon) will handle true multi-session orchestration: separate Claude sessions, persistent workers, direct context management instead of subagent nesting. The beads dependency graph persists across sessions - that's the ratchet that survives context resets.

### Changed

- **`/crank` skill** - Parallel wave execution:
  - Added `MAX_PARALLEL_AGENTS = 3` limit per wave
  - Step 4 now dispatches subagents in parallel via Task tool
  - FIRE loop updated to show wave model
  - `bd ready` explicitly documented as "returns current wave"

- **`/plan` skill** - Explicit wave formation:
  - Step 7 now shows how to create `blocks` dependencies
  - Added explanation of how waves form from dependencies
  - Clarified that `bd ready` returns parallelizable work

- **L4 implement-wave docs** - Updated max from 8 to 3 agents per wave

### Technical Details

The key instruction for `/crank`:

> **All Task calls for a wave MUST be in a single message to enable parallel execution.**

When Claude sends multiple Task tool calls in one message, they execute concurrently. Sequential messages = sequential execution. This is how we get parallelism without external orchestration.
